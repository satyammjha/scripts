The Board of Directors also does not discuss any ratings at its meetings. \n1 crore = 10 milion \nRefer to annexure for Details of Instruments & Bank Facilities \nDetailed Rationale \nCrisil Ratings has revised its outiook on the long-term bank loan facilities of Rajesh Power Services \nLtd (RPSL) \nto ‘Positive’ from ‘Stable’ while reaffirming its rating at ‘CRISIL BBB+\". Short term rating \nhas been reaffirmed at ‘CRISIL A2'. \nThe change in outlook factors in the improvement in the business risk profile of the company. Revenue \ngrew \nto \nRs. \n313.06 crores in fiscal H1FY2025, supported \nby healthy order book and \nimproving \noperating \nmargin. \nThe \nfinancial \nrisk \nprofile \nis \nhealthy, as \nreflected \nin \nestimated \nnetworth, gearing and total outside liabilities to adjusted networth ratio of Rs 283.2 crore, 0.05 time \nand 0.65 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2025. Liquidity continues to be strong, with moderately \nutilised bank lines, healthy expected cash accrual against negligible debt obligation and need-based \nfunding support from the promoters to cover working capital requirement. \nThe ratings reflect the extensive experience of the promoters in the heavy electrical equipment and \nengineering, procurement and construction (EPC) industry along with the growing scale of operations, \nhealthy operating margin and comfortable financial risk profile of the company. These strengths are \npartially offset by susceptibility to risks inherent in tender-based business and large working capital \nrequirement. \nAnalytical Approach \nUnsecured loan of Rs 51.76 crore as on as on March 31, 2024, from the promoters has been treated \nas 75% equity and 25% debt as the loan is subordinate to bank debt and may remain in the business \nover the medium term. \nCrisil Ratings has considered the standalone business and financial risk profiles of RPSL. \nKey Rating Drivers & Detailed Description \nStrengths: \nLongstanding presence in the construction industry: Experience of more than four decades in the \nheavy electrical equipment and EPC industry has enabled the promoters to build strong relationships \nwith reputed customers such as Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Ltd and Uttar Gujarat Vij \nCompany Ltd. The promoters have also diversified into the engineering, procurement, and construction \n(EPC) business and \nbuilt \na small, though \nhighly profitable, \nsolar division. RPSL has \na healthy \noutstanding orderbook to be executed \nin the next 2-3 years provide healthy medium-term revenue \nvisibility. Timely execution of these orders will remain a key rating sensitivity factor. \nIncreasing scale of operations and healthy operating margin: Revenue is expected to improve at \nhealthy rate in fiscal 2025 and is likely to grow over the medium term supported by healthy order book \nand timely execution of orders. Operating margin is expected to remain 11-12% over the medium term. \nComfortable financial risk profile: The financial risk profile may continue to strengthen over the \nmedium term in the absence of any large, debt-funded capital expenditure (capex). Networth, gearing \nand total outside liabilities to tangible networth (TOLTNW) ratio were Rs 123.12 crore, 0.34 time and \n0.97 time, respectively, as on March 31, 2024. Debt protection metrics were comfortable, as indicated \nby interest coverage and net cash accrual \nto adjusted debt ratios of 4.74 times and 0.64 time, \nrespectively, in fiscal 2024. The interest coverage ratio is expected to improve over the medium term \nwith a sharp rise in revenue along with improvement in profitability. \nWeakness: \nSusceptibility to risks inherent in tender-based business: As the company derives its entire \nrevenue from tender-based orders, its ability to successfully bid for projects is critical. Furthermore, \nintense competition necessitates aggressive bidding, compromising on the operating margin. Given \nthe cyclicality inherent in the construction industry, the ability to maintain profitability through operating \nefficiency becomes critical. RPSL is also susceptible to the risk of end-user concentration in revenue \nas majority of the topline accrues from Guijarat. \nLarge working capital requirement: Operations will likely remain working capital intensive over the \nmedium term. Gross current assets were at more than 215 days as on March 31, 2024, driven by \nreceivables of 146 days and inventory of 53 days. Payables of 55 days partly support the working \ncapital \ncycle. \nAbility \nof the company to efficiently manage \nits working \ncapital \ncycle will remain \nmonitorable. \nLiquidity Adequate \nLiquidity will remain supported by the surplus in cash accrual and bank lines. Bank limit utilisation was \n60.66%, on average, for the 14 months through February 2025. Cash accrual is expected at Rs 70-80 \ncrore per annum against yearly debt obligation of Rs 1-2 crore over the medium term. Current ratio \nwas healthy at 1.87 times as on March 31, 2024. The promoters have extended need-based funds \n(equity and unsecured loan of Rs 51.76 crore as on as on March 31, 2024, to aid operations. Low \ngearing and moderate networth should boost financial flexibility. \nOutlook Positive \nRPSL will continue to benefit from improved operating efficiency and comfortable financial risk profile. \nRating sensitivity factors \nUpward factors: \ne \nRevenue more than Rs 1,500 crore and healthy operating margin leading to higher cash \naccrual \ne \nSteady improvement in the working capital cycle \nDownward factors: \ne \nLarger-than-expected capex or further stretch in the working capital cycle, with TOLTNW ratio \nof \n1.5 times \no \nDecline in revenue and/or profitability\nAbout the Company \nRPSL was set up as a partnership, Rajesh Traders, in 1971. The firm was reconstituted as a private \nlimited company, Rajesh Power Services PvtLtd, in January 2010 and subsequently as a public limited \ncompany in June 2024.

Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Director's use of the going concern \nbasis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on \nthe ability of the Holding Company, to continue as a going concern. If we conclude \nthat a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's \nreport to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are \ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence \nobtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions \nmay cause the Holding Company to cease to continue as a going concern. \n8.5.

SBICAP Trustee Company Limited has been appointed as Trustee (the \n\"Debenture Trustees\") for the subscribers to the NCDs. \n3. \nPursuant to Regulation 56(1)(d) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure \nRequirements) Regulations, 2015, as master circular no. SEBI / HO / DDHS-\nPoD3/P /CIR/2024/ 46 dated 16th May, 2024, and Regulation 15(1)(t) of the Securities and \nExchange Board of India (Debenture Trustees) Regulations, 1993, as amended from time \nto time, (together referred to as the \"Regulations\"), the Company is required to submit to \nsubmit to Stock Exchange and Debenture Trustees a certificate regarding maintenance of \nSecurity Cover. \n4. \nAccordingly, we, as Statutory Auditor of the Company, have been requested by the \nCompany to examine the accompanying \"Statement of Security Cover as at 31st March, \n2025 from column A to J, L and N\" (the \"Statement\"). The accompanying Statement has \nbeen prepared by the Management of the Company from the financial statements, books \nof accounts and other relevant records maintained by the Company. \nManagement's Responsibility \n5. \nThe preparation of the Statement is the responsibility of the Management of the Company \nincluding the preparation and maintenance of all accounting and other relevant \nsupporting records and documents. This responsibility includes the design, \nimplementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and \npresentation of the Statement and applying an appropriate basis of preparation; and \n~\n=:::::,.::m.aking estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. \nSIM&c. \nCA M M NISSIM & co LLP \nI NO I A \nCHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS \nContinuation Sheet ........ \nManagement's Responsibility (Continued) \n6. \nManagement of the Company is also responsible for ensuring that the Company complies \nwith all the relevant requirements of the Regulations and for providing all relevant \ninformation to the Debenture Trustees. \nAuditor's Responsibility \n7. \nOur responsibility is to provide limited assurance as to whether anything has come to our \nattention that causes us to believe that the particulars contained in the aforesaid Statement \nwith respect to book value of asset charged against the listed Debentures issued by the \nCompany are not in agreement with the financial statements, books of accounts and other \nrelevant records as at 31st March, 2025 maintained by the Company. \n8. \nWe conducted our examination of the Statements, on test basis, in accordance with the \nGuidance Note on Reports or Certificates for Special Purposes (Revised 2016) issued by \nthe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\"). The Guidance Note requires that \nwe comply with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the ICAI. \n9. \nOur scope of work did not include verification of compliance with any other requirement \nof other circulars and notifications issued by any regulatory authorities from time to time \nand any other laws and regulations applicable to the Company. Further, our scope of \nwork did not involve performing audit tests for the purpose of expressing an opinion on \nthe fairness or accuracy of any of the financial information or the financial statements of \nthe Company, taken as a whole. We have not performed an audit, the objective of which \nwould be the expression of an opinion on the financial statements, of specified elements, \naccounts or items thereof for the purpose of this certificate. Accordingly, we do not \nexpress such an opinion. \n10. We have complied with the relevant applicable requirements of the Standard on Quality \nControl (SQC) 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical \nFinancial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements issued by \nthe ICAI. \n11. A limited assurance engagement includes performing procedures to obtain sufficient \nappropriate evidence on the applicable criteria. The procedures performed vary in nature \nand timing from, and are less extent than for, a reasonable assurance. Consequently, the \nlevel of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have \nbeen obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The procedures \nselected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the areas where \na material misstatement of the subject matter information is likely to arise. For the \npurpose of this engagement, we have performed following procedures: \na. \nObtained and read the relevant clauses of Trust Deeds in respect of the listed \nDebentures and noted the Security Cover required to be maintained by the Company \nin respect of such Debentures, as indicated in the Statement. \nQ\\ M M NISSIM & CO LLP \n• \nIND I A \nCHART ERED ACCOUNTANTS \nContinuation Sheet ....... . \nAuditor's Responsibility (Continued) \nb. \nTraced the principal amount of the Debentures outstanding as at 31st March, 2025, to \nthe financial statements, the books of account and other relevant records maintained \nby the Company. \nc. \nObtained and read the list of book debts charged as security in respect of the \nDebentures outstanding. \nd. \nTraced the value of book debts from the Statement to the financial statements, books \nof accounts and other relevant records maintained by the Company as at 31st March, \n2025. \ne.

P. Chitale & Co. \nChartered Accountants \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section \n143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors' \nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results section of our report. We are \nindependent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the \nStandalone Financial Results, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with \nthese requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \nManagement and Board of Directors' Responsibility for the Audited Standalone Financial Results \nThese Standalone Financial Results have been compiled from the annual Standalone Financial Statements \nand approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The Board of Directors are responsible for the \npreparation of these Standalone Financial Results that give a true and fair view of the net profit for the \nquarter and net profit for the year and other financial information in accordance with the recognition \nand measurement principles laid down in Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, \nread with Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, as amended to the extent applicable, the \nrelevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI guidelines and other accounting \nprinciples generally accepted in India and in compliance with the Listing Regulations. This responsibility \nalso includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act, \nBanking Regulation Act, 1949 and RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for \npreventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate \naccounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, \nimplementation and maintenance of adequate \ninternal \nfinancial controls that were operating \neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the \npreparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Results that give a true and fair view and are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Results, the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the \nBank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern \nand using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate \nthe Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThe Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process. \nAuditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Results as a \nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' \nort that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee \nt an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it \nts. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \n2 \nKalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP \nChartered Accountants \nM. P. Chitale & Co. \nChartered Accountants \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of these Standalone Financial Results. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional \nskepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n• \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Results, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, \nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one \nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n• \nObtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design \naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, \nwe are also responsible for expressing our opinion through a separate report on whether the \nBank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial \nStatements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. \n• \nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. \n• \nConclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of \naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists \nrelated to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue \nas a going concern.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Consolidated Financial \nResults. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain \nprofessional skepticism throughout the audit.

And there will be an opportunity \nfor you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the \nconference call, please signal an operator by pressing “*”, then “0” on your touch tone phone. \nPlease note that this conference is being recorded.  \nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Ravi Swaminathan from Avendus Spark. Thank you and \nover to you, sir. \nRavi Swaminathan: \nA warm welcome to the Q4 FY ‘25 Earnings Call of Shilchar Technologies. \nTo take us through the Results today, we have with us from the Management Mr. Alay Shah – \nManaging Director; Mr. Aashay Shah – Executive Director; Mr. Aatman Shah – Manager \nOperations; and Mr. Prajesh Purohit – the CFO.  \nWe will start with a brief opening remark on the business performance of the quarter and full \nyear from Mr. Alay Shah and then open the floor for Q&A. Thank you and over to you, sir. \nAlay Shah: \nHello, everyone, and good evening. I am Alay Shah – Managing Director of Shilchar \nTechnologies Limited. Thank you for joining us today. \nBefore we open the floor for questions, I would like to provide a brief update on our performance \nfor the quarter and the full year.  \nI am pleased to report that both Q4 and Year ‘25 have been exceptional for Shilchar \nTechnologies with strong results across all key metrics. Operationally, we achieved significant \nmilestones, including the successful commissioning of capacity expansion in the month of \nAugust and a subsequent ramp up in production in the following quarters. Notably, we reached \nfull capacity utilization in Q4, well ahead of our original target in Year ‘26. As a result, we \ndelivered our highest ever top line and bottom-line performance, both on a quarterly and annual \nbasis. This robust revenue growth has driven positive operating leverage while maintaining \nhealthy gross margins, leading to a market improvement in our EBITDA and net profits.  \nThe transformer industry continues to benefit from several favorable trends. India's electricity \nconsumption is rising and is projected to peak at 273 gigawatts in June ‘25. Investments in \ngeneration capacity across both renewable and conventional sources remain very strong, \ncomplemented by significant capital expenditure in power transmission and distribution sector. \nSub-segments such as renewable, including solar and wind are poised for a continued growth, \nsupported by the Government of India's ambitious plan of 500 gigawatts green energy road map \nfor 2030.  \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 3 of 18 \n \nGiven this demand trend, there is potential for further investment in our manufacturing capacity. \nWhile we have not yet finalized specifics, I want to assure you that Shilchar is fully prepared to \ncapitalize on the emerging opportunities in the transformer sector. For the immediate future, our \nfocus remains on optimizing existing operations and consolidating our recent gains.  \nI would also like to address the recent update regarding reciprocal tariffs by the new US \nAdministration. As of now, there are no reciprocal tariffs on the export of transformers from \nIndia to US. And thus, there is no immediate impact on Shilchar’s exports. We will, however, \nclosely monitor the situation as the 90-day tariff pause concludes, and we will adopt our strategy, \nshould any change arise.  \nOur outlook remains positive for both domestic and export markets, though we expect the \ndomestic business to experience higher growth in the coming financial year. Accordingly, we \nanticipate a somewhat greater share of domestic revenue in the upcoming financial year.  \nFinally, recognition of this year’s strong performance. The Board has recommended a final \ndividend of Rs. 12.5 per equity share, subject to shareholders’ approval. Additionally, the Board \nhas approved the equity bonus issue, 1 new fully paid-up equity share for every 2 shares held \nby eligible shareholders.  \nIn conclusion, we are optimistic about the future and remain committed to achieving our growth \nobjectives while maintaining operational excellence.  \nThank you for your attention. I would now like to open the floor for your questions. \nModerator: \nThank you. We will now begin with the question-and-answer session. The first question comes \nfrom the line of Abhi Jain from AJ Capital. Please go ahead. \nAbhi Jain: \nSo, a couple of questions, sir. One is, I discussed this last time on the concall also, what are the \nplans on listing on NSE? Because last time you said that in the 4th Quarter of FY ‘25 you would \nplan to do that, but since we have passed that so wanted to understand that. \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, that plan is already, for NSE listing we need to have a minimum Rs. 10 crores of paid-\nup capital, which we will be eligible by giving this bonus share. So, once the bonus shares are \nissued, our authorized capital will be to Rs. 11.44 crores. And after that, we will be applying to \nNSE for the listing. \nAbhi Jain: \nOkay. Sir second question was, obviously you have covered in your presentation and in your \nopening remarks also that the current situation with the US tariffs is moving and nobody can \nascertain right now what will happen. But I just wanted to understand it internally, have you \ncome up with a risk mitigation plan? Are you thinking of derisking? Are you thinking of \nreducing your reliance on the US in terms of revenue? Because domestically the demand that is \nthere and all the other competitors of yours who are more focused on domestic market, I mean, \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 4 of 18 \n \nthe demand is there and you might have also been seeing it and witnessing it. So, there are a lot \nof options available in terms of derisking from the US. So, just wanted to understand from your \nperspective what are you doing?  \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, I mean, we have our own strategies. Suppose after 90 days if there are tariffs levied \nfrom export of transformers from India to US, I would not like to go much in detail. But, I mean, \nwe are very confident that our business will not be that much affected with those tariffs. I mean, \nwe are very well placed in terms of our product, our quality, our service with our customers. \nAlso, the North American sales is only like less than 20% of our total revenue, so rest is all other \ncountries and domestic market. So, there will not be any significant impact.  \nAbhi Jain: \nAlright. Thank you, sir. Final question, sir, given that the outlook on the industry is pretty strong \nand everyone in the industry is currently seeing more demand than supply, and obviously you \nhave also indicated something to the tune of same. And you have also indicated that as and when \nit is necessary you will disclose to the shareholders in terms of our expansion plan. But I just \nwanted to understand that since you are already achieving your capacity utilization before time, \nwhat is the probabilistic capacity expansion that you are looking in the next 12 to 18 months? \nCurrently you are at 7,500, so how do you see it ramping up in the next 12 to 18 months? Just a \nglide part would be helpful.  \nAlay Shah: \nSo, we have still not finalized the concrete plan, but we are already working on the expansion \nthat how we would like to do it, until what capacity we want to do it, and what is the maximum \nrating which we would like to have with this new capacity. Everything is going on in detail and \nwe are also working on the budgeting, what will be the cost, what will be the land area which \nwill be required and all those things. Once everything gets finalized and once we are ready to \nstart the expansion project, we will definitely come back to all our shareholders and give \npresentation with complete details.  \nAbhi Jain: \nThank you so much, sir. I like your candor and honesty. Just wanted to tell you that if we can \nhave these concalls every quarter, that would be helpful, rather than having it after six months \nor a year.  \nAlay Shah: \nSure. Will keep that in mind. Thank you.  \nAbhi Jain: \nThank you so much. \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Ninad Sarpotdar from Aditya Birla Money. \nPlease go ahead. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nYes. So, I wanted to ask the first question regarding the TAM, the addressable market. Like you \ndiscussed in previous concalls, for taking a hypothetical number, say, for 1 gigawatt of solar \nenergy you need 1 gigawatt of transformation power, am I correct, is that the right ratio? \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 5 of 18 \n \nAlay Shah: \nYes, that is the right ratio. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nYes. And your product is only installed at the generation point. Ideally for transformation it’s at \nthe generation point and as well as the end consumption point. So, if you put up a 1 gigawatt \nsolar energy per se, so you will need 2 gigawatts of transformation power, is my understanding \ncorrect? So, your TAM is half because your product is put at generation point? Just wanted to \nknow. \nAlay Shah: \nNo, I actually do not understand your question technically what you are trying to say. But what \nI can explain you is that our transformers are used for generating voltage, and they are stepping \nup the voltage from the solar panel which are like 800 volts or 700 volts to 33 kV volts. And \nthose 33 kV volts are fitted into the grid. So, against the 1 gigawatt of generation, the total \ncapacity of transformer required is 1 gigawatt. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nOkay. So, that's for only stepping up the power, right? \nAlay Shah: \nCorrect, yes. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nAnd for stepping down also you need transformers, like on the opposite end, right? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, but that is at the consumer level or at the distribution level or substation level. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nSo, that’s the product you are not into. I understood. And sir, the second question that since now \nUS is focused more on to conventional power and they have shifted the focus from renewable \ndevelopment or growth, do you see any demand fluctuation from that market or how the export \nscenario is looking for US? \nAlay Shah: \nNo, right now the US market is very, very robust and there is lot of demand in all segments. \nAnd we are not specific to any one segment for our export business, so we cater to all kinds of \ntransformers. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nOkay. But your 60% sale is from inverted duty transformers, right? \nAlay Shah: \nThat is for local business. \nNinad Sarpotdar: \nOkay. Got it. Yes, that's all from my side. Thank you so much. \nAlay Shah: \nYes. Thank you. \nModerator: \nThe next question comes from the line of Mahesh Bendre from LIC Mutual Fund. Please go \nahead. \nMahesh Bendre: \nHi sir, thank you so much for the opportunity. Sir, I just wanted to understand the opportunity \nfor us in terms of step up transformer requirement in domestic market and export market, what \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 6 of 18 \n \nkind of inquiry flows you are witnessing right now? If we have to look for the next 12 to 18 \nmonths, what kind of opportunity is going to come on our way? \nAlay Shah: \nNo. So, demand is very strong in both domestic market as well as for export market. And we \nare flooded with inquiries, and we have at present a very good order position, orders on hand. \nSo, I do not see any downfall in the demand in the coming near future. \nMahesh Bendre: \nDo you see a strong demand in domestic market or is it both domestic and export side we are \nwitnessing the same? \nAlay Shah: \nNo, we are witnessing the same very strong demand in both domestic as well as in export market. \nMahesh Bendre: \nYes, because what we are currently witnessing is, in the transmission side there is huge demand \nfor transformers across 400 kV. So, when we look at the distribution transformer, is it the solar \nis the only driver or is it some other CAPEX that is coming up in distribution side that will drive \nthe growth? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, locally we do not supply any distribution transformer. We only supply locally solar IDT \ntransformers and wind transformers, and some power transformers for stations. \nMahesh Bendre: \nOkay, sure. Thank you so much, sir. \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Samyak Jain from Marcellus Investment \nManagers. Please go ahead. \nSamyak Jain: \nThank you for the opportunity. My first question is, so if I recall, our discussion in quarter two’s \nconcall, so you had mentioned that you will be standardizing the CAPEX plans or expansion \nplans by Jan ’25. So, I just wanted to understand if we have so strong demand visibility, like \nwhat are the reasons that the plans are still under discussion stage? So, just wanted to know your \nthoughts on that. \nAlay Shah: \nWe are already working on all the datas and drawings and what kind of capacity we want to \nincrease, what will the cost be, what kind of land which we will be requiring for this new \nCAPEX. We are going a bit slow because we are a bit conservative, we want to make sure that \nany expansion we do has to be manageable and sustainable. But the plan is already going on, \nand at the right moment we will make a formal announcement. \nSamyak Jain: \nGot it. Sir just to follow-up, so I believe once the plan is finalized, it will take a year's time for \nthe capacity to go live. So, do you foresee any loss of revenue or loss of orders due to any delay \nin finalizing the investment plans? Is there a chance of any loss on that front? \nAlay Shah: \nWell, I do not think so because once the plant is ready, much before that we will start marketing \nfor that particular plant and acquire the orders. So, I do not think there will be any loss of any \norders. \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 7 of 18 \n \nSamyak Jain: \nUnderstood sir. And a follow-up to a previous participant’s question. So, you mentioned that \nfor your expansion plans, you are also considering going for a higher rating transformers. So, \ndoes that mean that you are going for a higher kVA transformer? So, I just wanted to understand \na bit more about what's the plan on that front. \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, again, it is not finalized, but we are considering higher MVA and higher kV class of \nthe transformer. \nSamyak Jain: \nAlright, thank you so much.  \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Sunil Jain from Nirmal Bang Securities \nPrivate Limited. Please go ahead. \nSunil Jain: \nYes. Just to confirm, once you decide on the expansion and start making this implementation, \nhow much time will it take for the first production to come?  \nAlay Shah: \nYes, it will take anywhere between 12 months to 18 months to complete the project and start \nproduction. \nSunil Jain: \nAnd since you have done recently expansion, so land is already there or you need to acquire \nadditional land? \nAlay Shah: \nNo, we already have land. We have 17 acres of plot and hardly 40% is utilized so far. So, we \nhave ample land for further expansion. \nSunil Jain: \nYes. And in other utilities like connectivity to grid and all will be available? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, that is already available. \nSunil Jain: \nOkay, fine. And this order book, can you quantify, is it possible how much is the order book or \nno? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, at present I think our order book is close to Rs. 400 crores. \nSunil Jain: \nOkay. Great, sir. Thank you very much. \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Prolin Nandu from Edelweiss Public \nAlternatives. Please go ahead. \nProlin Nandu: \nMr. Shah, thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions from my side. On the state \nof the industry, right, while you are thinking of capacity expansion, a lot of your peers have \nalready announced capacity. And I was looking at, let's say, some of the top 10 players are \nexpanding capacity in the next three years by almost 50%, right. So, do you see a condition in \nthe market where there's an oversupply and there could be some pricing power? Could you help \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 8 of 18 \n \nus understand that, a lot of players are expanding capacity, and you are also probably thinking \nof doing it, so I mean is there a high probability of oversupply in the market in, let's say, next \ncouple of years? And could that lead to some sort of a high competitive intensity and pricing \nerosion in the market? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, I mean, we were ahead of all our competitors. We have already done our first expansion and \nstarted production in full swing. What we are talking right now is the 2nd Phase of expansion \nwhere all our competitors are still doing their 1st Phase of expansion. Yes, everybody is \nexpanding, so there will be huge capacity coming in the market in the next two to three years. \nBut at the same time, the government data shows that there will be a huge demand for \ntransformers also because they will be in a very huge demand for power, and government is \ndoing their best to meet this power demand. So, it's very difficult to say, but there will be a lot \nof progression and there will be a lot of demand also. \nProlin Nandu: \nOkay, understood, sir. Sir my second question is that one of your peers has gone for backward \nintegration in terms of lamination of CRGO, right. So, is it something we are also probably \nthinking to do? And if not, we are fine with our vendors who are doing it for us, can you help \nus understand what could be, I mean, when you will think about backward integration on this \naspect? And is it critical for you to probably move into higher kVA? Is this backward integration \none of the important things that needs to be? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, personally I feel that this backward integration is not required at all because there are enough \nsuppliers of laminations very close to our city, Vadodara. And we are able to get, we never face \nany shortage or any problems of lamination from any of them. So, personally, I feel that we \nshould concentrate on our product consumer and not its raw material (Inaudible) 22:57 in-\nhouse where our model is only to manufacture transformer and get everything from outside. \nProlin Nandu: \nUnderstood. And can I ask one more question, sir, if that's okay with you? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, go ahead. \nProlin Nandu: \nYes. So, sir, in the export market, right, where some of your transformers also go for the export \nmarket, and probably US is one of the key markets that you also highlighted to the previous \nparticipant’s question, could you help us understand that in US market what could be the share \nof transformers which are coming from, let's say, China? And because of these tariff issues, do \nyou see an opportunity for some of the Indian players to probably gain market share in US? \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, as far as US market is concerned, there are no Chinese transformers going into the US \nmarket because there are tariffs on that product since last so many years. But there are other \ncountries which are exporting transformers to the US market. And of course, there are lot of \nopportunities over there. \nProlin Nandu: \nOkay. Understood, sir. Thank you. That's it from my side. \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 9 of 18 \n \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Balasubramanian from Arihant Capital. \nPlease go ahead. \nBalasubramanian A: \nGood evening, sir. Congratulations for good set of numbers. Sir, you mentioned about North \nAmerica sales are less than 20% of revenue. I have seen the presentations, like could you please \nshare the exports breakup for these 5 continents, America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia \nfor FY ‘25? \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, I do not understand your question. \nBalasubramanian A: \nSir, for exports, we are supplying to five continents, America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and \nAsia. And like if you could share approximate exports breakup for these continents? \nAlay Shah: \nI cannot give you a precise number, but at least I can say that North America is about 20% of \nour total export, and the rest is around 80%, mainly Middle East and North Africa. \nBalasubramanian A: \nGot it, sir. Sir, on that CAPEX front, I am looking at the historical data. It took first 18 years to \nachieve 1,000 MVA to 4,000 MVA, and from 4,000 MVA to 7,500 MVA it took only six, seven \nyears. So, based on the historical CAPEX capacity expansion, so whether we can able to take \nanother 3,000 to 4,000 additional NVAs in next three, four years, is that right assumptions we \ncan look at? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, there is a possibility. \nBalasubramanian A: \nYes. Thank you, sir. That's it.  \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Arpit Shah from Stallion Asset. Please go \nahead. \nArpit Shah: \nYes. Congratulations, Alay. You have just done a fantastic job executing such a large number \nof transformers.  \nAlay Shah: \nThank you. \nArpit Shah: \nJust wanted to understand how sustainable is this number of Rs. 220 crores on a quarterly basis? \nOr you think this number has been led up in anticipation of tariffs to be and leading to higher \norders in the last 15 days of the month? So, I just wanted to understand how sustainable is the \nRs. 220 crores revenue number going ahead? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, first of all, I mean, that tariff issue started only from first week of April and we cannot pull \nup numbers in anticipation of tariffs in last year. So, that is an assumption on your side. But I \nmean, if you look at our track record, I mean, since last 11 quarters we have been performing \nvery consistently as far as our margins are concerned. And I am sure that we will continue to do \nthat. That will be our goal to maintain this profitability and also improve it. \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 10 of 18 \n \nArpit Shah: \nGot it. So, you have continued to surprise us with 28% margins, now we have come up to about \n31%, so how should we look at this number going ahead, should it continue to go higher? Or \nthis is the number that you would be looking as a sustainable run rate? \nAlay Shah: \nAre you talking about EBITDA margins or revenue? \nArpit Shah: \nYes, EBITDA margins. \nAlay Shah: \nLike I said, we will try our best to maintain this, or maybe even improve it, why not. \nArpit Shah: \nGot it. And you will be looking to double the capacity, or will you be looking to announce it in \na in a month or so? \nAlay Shah: \nLike I said, we are still working on it. At the right moment we will give you all the details. \nArpit Shah: \nAnd what is the aspiration that you are looking at? What kind of ambition you are looking at in \nterms of numbers to build in? How big do you think in terms of what kind of PAT targets you \nhave maybe, let’s say, Rs. 6,500 crores PAT number, maybe what you are looking at? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, again, depends on the complete project viability. We are working on numbers. And once we \nfinalize that, okay, this is the capacity which we want to increase and this is the CAPEX which \nwe want to incur for this increase in capacity, we will give you all the numbers that then what \nwill be the revenue from that and what will be the PAT. \nArpit Shah: \nSir, I was just trying to understand one thing -- \nModerator: \nJust one question. Just one question. Just trying to understand one thing, sir, it’s not that our \nCAPEX is being used, it's only Rs. 30 crores the last time we spent CAPEX. Even if we double \ncapacity, and assuming you go wrong, okay, you will lose probably one quarter of profit, it’s \nnot going to cause a loss of more than that, right.  So, why so conservative in capacity addition, \njust trying to understand? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, like I said, I mean, I said this earlier also that any expansion has to be manageable and \nsustainable. Why are we doing the best EBITDA? Why our company is having the best EBITDA \nmargin in the industry among all our peers? So, we are doing something extraordinary which \nwe would like to maintain it.  \nArpit Shah: \nRight, right. So, competition cannot come in basically so easily in our products, even assuming \nthere's a market out there, even though we are not increasing capacity very fast, we are not \nscared that some other competition will come and take our market away.  \nAlay Shah: \nSo, we are increasing capacity fast, like, I mean, we did increase our capacity from 4,000 MVA \nto 7,500 MVA and that was only in this year. So, further expansion we will be doing it. But, \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 11 of 18 \n \nagain, like I said, we are working in detail with all the numbers then we will inform you at the \nright moment. \nArpit Shah: \nGot it, sir. Good luck, sir. Good luck. So, nice speaking to you. \nAlay Shah: \nThank you. \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Aman Soni from Nvest Analytics Advisory \nLLP. Please go ahead. \nAman Soni: \nAlay sir, congrats for a decent set of numbers. Just in continuation with earlier participants only, \nlike, you are saying demand is very decent, particularly in the domestic market. And in your \nopening remarks you also mentioned that exports are also having a decent demand. So, my \nquestion is, like in this quarter we are operating at fuller utilization. So, do you see for rest of \nthe quarters, obviously, for all the quarters in ’26 are we going to maintain these kind of \nutilization levels? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, that's the plan. So, for this coming year, Year ‘25-‘26, we are targeting around Rs. 750 \ncrores in sales in top line. \nAman Soni: \nBut in this quarter we did around Rs. 230 crores revenue. So, going by that, should not it be \nclose to Rs. 950 crores a full year? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, if you look at historically, the first quarter for transformer industry is always low sales, and \nthen gradually every quarter the sales increases, and Q4 is the maximum sales for all the \ncompanies, being capital equipment. So, if you consider the same scenario for this coming year, \nI think we should be able to comfortably reach to Rs. 750 crores or more. \nAman Soni: \nUnderstood. Rs. 750 crores is just I think 20% kind of growth from our existing numbers, right? \nThat's what you are targeting? \nAlay Shah: \nSorry, I cannot hear you. I did not hear you. \nAman Soni: \nThat means 20% kind of the growth we are targeting for next year, right? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, some 20%, 25%, yes. \nAman Soni: \nUnderstood, understood. Okay, sir, all of my questions are answered. Thank you very much, sir. \nThank you. \nAlay Shah: \nThank you. \nModerator: \nThe next question comes from the line of Rucheeta Kadge from iWealth. Please go ahead. \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 12 of 18 \n \nRucheeta Kadge: \nHello, sir. Very good evening. Sir, first of all, I would like to understand on the export side of \nbusiness. So, during this year what is the kind of revenue that we have done on the export side? \nAnd what are the products, like where are we selling these transformers to? I understand it's not \nthe solar inverter duty one, so which other transformers are we selling there? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, I think we have done export of almost 44% of our total revenue this year. And we supply all \nkind of transformers, we export IDTs also for solar and then we supply distribution transformers \nalso. So, it's a complete mix range of transformers which we export. \nRucheeta Kadge: \nAnd sir, would the realizations be different in domestic versus export? Because I have been \nseeing some data points of your export, and it looks like on the export side of it you make around \nRs. 20 lakhs, Rs. 22 lakhs of realization versus domestic around Rs. 6 lakhs, Rs. 7 lakhs. So, \nthere's like a steep difference. So, just want to understand, like, how different is the product? \nAlay Shah: \nNo. So, I mean, domestic we supply the higher rating of transformers like 10 MVA, 15 MVA, \n20 MVA, that is our major sale. Therefore, export it is smaller ratings of transformers, so that is \nwhy you cannot compare the price. Transformer is a big area and there are many, many different \ntypes and sizes and ratings of transformers. So, you cannot generalize the costing based on this. \nRucheeta Kadge: \nUnderstood, understood. So, just for MVA I was just calculating, so was just trying to \nunderstand like why the difference was there, but understood currently. And sir, on the margin \nside, right, we are doing better than the industry, is it mainly because the export portion for us \nis higher than what the industry is doing, like around 10%, 20%? \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, I have said this in the past also that export gives us better revenue compared to \ndomestic. But at the same time, we run this company very efficiently with very less expense, \nand that is how our margins are on the higher side compared to our competitors. \nRucheeta Kadge: \nUnderstood, sir. Thank you so much. \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Shantanu Srivastava from SMIFS Limited. \nPlease go ahead. \nShantanu Basu: \nI think my name has been wrongly said. My name is Shantanu Basu. So, the question that I have \nis, and I am from SMIFS Limited. So, the question that I have is, when I am looking at your \nbalance sheet, so basically I am seeing a huge jump in receivables disproportionate to the \nrevenue increase. So, can you please explain as to why this receivable position went up so high?  \nAlay Shah: \nCan you please repeat the question? I could barely hear you. \nShantanu Basu: \nOkay. Can you hear me now, sir? \nAlay Shah: \nYes.  \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 13 of 18 \n \nShantanu Basu: \nOkay. So, I was saying that when I looked at your balance sheet, the FY ‘25 trade receivables \nportion is very high compared to FY ‘24. There has been very good growth in revenue, but the \ngrowth in receivables is disproportionate to that, it’s very high. So, can you please explain as to \nwhy this happened?  \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, there are two, three reasons. One is that when the revenue increases you need more \nworking capital. The majority of the sales which has come from last quarter, and we have the \nterms of LC with all our customer with 180 days of payout. And we can encash this LC if we \nneed the funds, but we do not do it and we wait for 180 days to receive the fund which we get \nit with interest. Because we have surplus fund, we do not encash the LCs. So, that is why the \nnumber looks bigger, but actually it is not an outstanding, we are earning interest out of that.  \nShantanu Basu: \nSo, I mean, in essence have your receivable days increased compared to historical terms?  \nAlay Shah: \nSo, like, with customers I have a payment term of, I mean, LC with payment term of 180 days \nwhere 30 days interest is to the sellers account, but the rest is with the buyers account. So, \ntechnically I can encash the LC within 30 days and get my money, but I do not do that because \nwe have surplus funds. So, we wait till 180 days and get the interest and then receive the money. \nBut on balance sheet it looks as if receivable. \nShantanu Basu: \nOkay. And how much percentage of receivables is that which is LC backed?  \nAlay Shah: \nI think the domestic market is almost entirely against the LC.  \nShantanu Basu: \nOkay. So, domestically you are doing against LC, okay. Not the export? \nAlay Shah: \nEven export also with LC or with advanced payment, I mean, there are various terms with \nvarious customers.  \nShantanu Basu: \nSo, on an aggregate, how much percentage would be LC backed, roughly, ballpark figure sir? \nAlay Shah: \nBallpark figure would be about 70%, 75%.  \nShantanu Basu: \nAnd is this your normal trend?  \nModerator: \nSorry to interrupt, Shantanu, those were your two questions. I would request you to rejoin the \nqueue. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jainam Vora from Soltoro \nInvestment Advisors. Please go ahead. \nJainam Vora: \nYes. Congratulations on a great set of results. My question was similar to what Shantanu was \nasking, so I will just ask my first question regarding that. So, on an overall basis, how much of \nthe trade receivables is LC backed is what I would want to know first, and then I will ask my \nsecond question.  \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 14 of 18 \n \nAlay Shah: \nI think I already answered that, it's almost like 70% to 75% ballpark figure.  \nJainam Vora: \nOkay. And with the share of domestic increasing, as you have said, continuing on the same \nquestion with the domestic share increasing, do you see, increase in this LC and trade \nreceivables days increasing? As well as the margins kind of getting deflated because the share \nof domestic would increase, so what are a sustainable level of margins and receivable days that \nyou are trying to look at? If you could share that, it would be great.  \nAlay Shah: \nLike I said, this receivable is not actually receivable, I mean, I already explained earlier. So, it \ndoesn't matter. I mean, if we need money we can get it any day. But our cash flow situation is \nvery good and we are totally a debt-free company, we have surplus funds. So, we just keep our \nLC with us, and on the due date after 180 days we get the payment with interest, and that is an \nother income for us.  \nJainam Vora: \nSo, none of your receivables are more than a year, is that a fair assumption? Or you have \ncustomers from receivables for more than a year? \nAlay Shah: \nNo. \nJainam Vora: \nOkay. And what about the margins, given the fact that domestic share is going to continue to \nincrease, as you said, the government trust and solar identity and all that as you have said, is \nthat going to be two different margin? Given how the export situation is overall as well, as the \ndeglobalization trend starts kicking in, what is Shilchar trying to do to continue to maintain \nthose kind of margins and deal with the competition?  \n \nBecause I think in terms of competition as well, one of your competitors has announced a 15,000 \nMVA capacity increase, out of which about half of it is going to be for IDT transformers. So, if \nyou could provide some color about that, it would be great, because your journey so far has been \ngreat but coming into the future with so many variables at hand, and as you have said that you \ncontinue to do extraordinary things, if you could take two to three years out what are the things \nthat you are going to do, it would be helpful.  \nAlay Shah: \nSo, we are going to continue to be innovative and we are going to continue to be efficient in \nmanaging the company and keeping our overheads low. In which margin will remain as it is \nbecause we will be growing and our overheads will continue to be on lower side. So, even if \nthere is a price pressure, there will be a decent margin which we will be able to have.  \nJainam Vora: \nBut do you see price pressure actually happening -- \nModerator: \nSorry to interrupt, Jainam, those were your two questions. I would request you to rejoin the \nqueue. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ashutosh Garud from Ambit \nWealth PMS. Please go ahead. \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 15 of 18 \n \nAshutosh Garud: \nThe kind of capacities which you have, and given the fact that the demand outlook is so good \ndomestically and internationally, and even you are confident from a margin perspective, you are \nexpecting just a 20% growth from a revenue term, say, for the next year. So, wouldn't there be \na case of much faster growth given the kind of scenario you just mentioned?  \nAlay Shah: \nYes. So, I mean, 20%, 25% is a conservative figure which I am telling. And if you look at our \ntrack record, we have always beat the projection what we have shared at the beginning of the \nyear. We will do our best to even grow much more than what we have said. \nAshutosh Garud: \nOkay, okay. And any particular reason why, from a tariff perspective, transformers are being \nexempted, any particular reason for that?  \nAlay Shah: \nSorry, can you repeat the question please?  \nAshutosh Garud: \nAny particular reason why the transformers have been exempted from US tariff list I am saying? \nAlay Shah: \nI have no idea, but it's good for us, right?  \nAshutosh Garud: \nNo, absolutely. Absolutely. So, any thoughts around, if at all that would happen in future, I \nmean, just wanted to get a sense around that because although they are not included in the list, \nbut will it be a case where you see that it could very well happen with the 10%, 20% tariffs \ncoming in, that is what from an industry sense I wanted to understand.  \nAlay Shah: \nSo, frankly speaking, I do not think that will happen. I mean, we have been talking to all our \ncustomers when they are also very confident. But even if that happens, we have already worked \nout some strategy which I cannot share it right now, but it won't affect our business or our \nexports. \nAshutosh Garud: \nOkay. Thank you. \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Gunjan Kabra from Niveshaay. Please go \nahead. \nGunjan Kabra: \nHi, Alay. Thank you so much for the opportunity. And congratulations on the good set of \nnumbers to you and your entire team. \nAlay Shah: \nThank you. \nGunjan Kabra: \nJust one question. Alay, since last two, three quarters we used to hear that the lead time in the \ntransformer industry in the domestic market is around 1.5, 2 years, and in the export market it \nwas much higher. So, how has that been trending out now going forward? \nAlay Shah: \nSo, I think, the lead time still remains the same in the power transformer industry. But the \nadvantage with us is that, again, I am repeating the same thing, we have been very efficient and \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 16 of 18 \n \nvery on demand on the situation where we are able to deliver our transformer with shorter lead \ntime, and that gives us an advantage with our customers. \nGunjan Kabra: \nAnd likewise, in the export market also it's the similar thing or you have it ready with you now, \nbecause of the material availability? \nAlay Shah: \nNo, in export also the lead time is, I think it has even gone longer, because there is still lot of \ndemand in the export market as well. \nGunjan Kabra: \nOkay. Because I was just assuming because the raw material availability has eased up, has the \nlead time reduced with respect to the demand and more supply coming in? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, it's not raw material availability, it's more of what you have. So, if there is a backlog and \nthen if you are having a constraint with the capacity then lead time also increases. So, there are \na lot of factors in the longer time. \nGunjan Kabra: \nOkay, got it. Thank you and good luck. \nAlay Shah: \nThank you. \nModerator: \nThe next question comes from the line of Arya Singh from Atishay Stockbroking. Please go \nahead. \nArya Singh: \nCongrats on the great set of numbers. Given that over 40% of your revenues come from exports, \ncould you please elaborate on the rationale behind not hedging your Forex exposure, especially \nconsidering the recent currency volatility, was this a strategic decision and how do you plan to \nmanage the margin impact going forward? \nAlay Shah: \nI could barely hear you. Can you repeat the question? Can you speak a bit louder? \nArya Singh: \nSure. Congratulations on the great set of numbers, first of all. Given that over 40% of your \nrevenues come from exports, could you please elaborate on the rationale behind not hedging \nyour Forex exposure, especially considering the recent currency volatility? \nAlay Shah: \nYes. Because, I mean, hedging is always a bit risky and we hardly import anything. So, it is only \nan inflow of foreign currency for us. The outflow is very less. So, we do not hedge. And if you \nsee last two, three years of our record, I mean, we have always gained foreign since currency, \nwe have never lost money. \nArya Singh: \nThank you. Also what is the current order book? \nAlay Shah: \nIt's between Rs. 350 crores to Rs. 400 crores. \nArya Singh: \nOkay. Thank you so much. \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 17 of 18 \n \nModerator: \nThank you. The next question comes from the line of Harsh Mehta from Cured Advisors. Please \ngo ahead. \nHarsh Mehta: \nYes. I just wanted to understand, in the presentation you mentioned that you have hit 100% \ncapacity utilization, but later on we can see a slide where you have shown a calculation \nhighlighting 77% capacity utilization. So, if you could just help us understand how the \ncalculation is working there? And as you had mentioned previously, the realizations were \naround Rs. 10 lakh per MVA, so has that changed?  \nAlay Shah: \nI am saying that the 100% capacity utilization is only for Q4 on a run rate basis. Since the \ncapacity only came in online in August, for the full year it was not available. And for the full \nyear, the utilization is at 77%.  \nHarsh Mehta: \nOkay. And for the realization part you had previously mentioned it was Rs. 10 lakh per MVA. \nSo, is that the same or has that changed?  \nAlay Shah: \nI do not think we have mentioned that in presentation, but I mean if you look at our last two, \nthree years of record, we are maintaining pretty much in this ballpark figure.  \nHarsh Mehta: \nOkay. And just one last question. So, you had mentioned to one participant earlier that you are \nplanning to expand into higher rated transformers, so approximately what kV class are you  \nplanning to expand to?  \nModerator: \nSir, we are still not able to hear you. Ladies and gentlemen, I would request you to stay online \nwhile I get the management reconnected. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have got the \nmanagement back. Please go ahead, sir. \nModerator: \nThe next question comes from the line of Viraj from Arjav Process. Please go ahead. \nViraj: \nWho are our exact peers and how are we exactly priced in? \nAlay Shah: \nSorry, can you repeat the question please? \nViraj: \nWhat I am asking is, who are our exact peers in this business and how are our products priced \ncompared to our peers? \nAlay Shah: \nThere are many companies within India who are competitors to us who in renewable energy \ntransformers. I mean, I can name few like Raychem, Danish Transformer, Transformer & \nRectifier and so on. \nViraj: \nOkay. And, sir, how are our products price compared to them? \n \nShilchar Technologies Limited \nApril 22, 2025 \n \n \nPage 18 of 18 \n \nAlay Shah: \nSo, we are competing with each other, so we have to be in line with everybody. I mean, no \ncustomer will give us very extraordinary premium, because of our quality service we get some \npremium but it is like maybe 1%, 2%, 3% maximum. \nViraj: \nOkay. And sir, if  US imposes that tariff on us, then do you expect competitive intensity to \nchange or any change in the competition? \nAlay Shah: \nNo, I do not think so. \nViraj: \nAlright. So, the situation will be same for everyone, right? \nAlay Shah: \nYes, exactly. \nViraj: \nOkay. Thank you. \nModerator: \nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we will take that as the last question \nfor today. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for the closing \ncomments. \nAlay Shah: \nYes. Thank you everybody for joining. Like I said, we will be growing this year by more than \n20%, 25%. We will try and fully utilize the capacity what we have created in last year during \nthe entire year. And I think the demand is very good, the market is very good. And we are, again, \nvery confident of having an excellent Year ‘25-’26. Thank you once again. \nModerator: \nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Avendus Spark, that concludes this \nconference. You may now disconnect your lines.", "status": "success"},

He demonstrated the Proof-of-Concept to PE firms, raised ₹810 crore ($94m) in equity by \n2012, recapitalized the company, and became Chairman and CEO.\"\nCapital First grew its retail loan book from ₹94 crore ($11m) in 2010 to ₹29,600 crore ($3.4b) by 2018, serving 7 million customers with high asset quality. The company turned around from \nlosses of ₹30 crore ($3m) to profits of ₹358 crore ($42m) during this period. Its share price increased from ₹122 in 2010 to ₹845 in 2018, with market cap rising tenfold to ₹8,200 crore \n($953m).\nIn 2017, Vaidyanathan sold 1.5% of his personal stake in Capital First to repay a loan used to acquire his ownership. To secure a commercial banking license for Capital First, he merged it with \nIDFC Bank in 2018 and became the MD and CEO of the renamed IDFC FIRST Bank.\nPost-merger, the loan book expanded to ₹ 2,41,926 crore ($28.5b) with significant growth in retail, rural, and MSME finance. Customer deposits increased from ₹38,455 crore ($4.5b) to \n₹2,42,543 crore ($28.5b) between 2018 and 2025, while the CASA ratio rose from 8.7% to 46.9%, and NIM at 6.1%.

It \nis submitted that State of UP on account of upsurge in the population in \nurban  areas,  formulated  a  policy  for  private  capital  investment  for \ndevelopment of Hi-Tech Township in Uttar Pradesh, which Policy was \ncirculated  on  22.11.2003,  which  was  subsequently  revised  by \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n7\nGovernment Order dated 16.08.2007.  Under the Policy, the Development \nAuthority  was  to  provide  land  to  the  Developer  under  the  Land \nAcquisition Act, 1894.  The Developer was also to obtain land by direct \npurchase.  The State was also entitled to provide land after resuming the \nland from different Gram Sabha under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and \nLand  Reforms  Act,  1950.

The LDA is entitled to \nretain transfer rights of 25% of saleable lands.   It was further submitted \nthat if the  CD  leaves any development work incomplete, the same is \nrequired  to  be  completed  by  LDA  through  sale  of  land,  so  retained. \nClause-8 of the Development Agreement dated 18.11.2006 has been relied \nby the LDA, which is as follows:\n“Performance  Guarantee  :  to  ensure  timely  completion  of  the \nproject as per the provisions of approved DPR, the First Party shall \nretain the transferable rights on 25 percent of total saleable land, \nwhich  shall  be  released  in  proportion  to  the  Second  Party  on \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.)

Various Mortgage Deeds has also been \nexecuted in favour of the CD to the extent of 424.4035 acres.  The CD has \nnot made the payments for various land acquired and resumed parcels of \nland.  The city development charges are also leviable on the CD, which \nhas not been paid. \n9.\nOther learned Counsel for the Intervenors have also made similar \nsubmissions  contending  that  admission of  CIRP shall cause immense \nprejudice to the Homebuyers in getting their Units.  It is submitted on \nbehalf  of  the  Homebuyers  that  in  event  CIRP  proceeds,  the  Project  - \nSushant Golf City, Hi-Tech Township be excluded.  It is submitted on \nbehalf  of  the  Intervenors  and  Homebuyers  that  in  the  present  case, \nProjects of the CD are situated in various cities of UP and Suspended \nDirector  of  the  CD,  having  expressed  his willingness  to  complete  the \nProjects, the CD can be resolved by Project-wise Resolution/ reverse CIRP \nmechanism.  Learned Counsel for the Appellant has also referred to the \njudgment of this Tribunal in Flat Buyers Association Winter Hills-77 \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n9\nvs. Umang Realtech Pvt. Ltd. – Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No.926 of \n2019.

Hence, the prayer for initiation of CIRP, confining to \nLucknow Project, cannot be accepted.  It is submitted that the Loan \nAgreement clearly provides for sanction for all Projects.  Learned Counsel \nfor the IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. has referred to the Loan Facility \nAgreement  and  Loan  Agreement,  which  are  part  of  the  record.   It  is \nfurther submitted that the settlement, which was accepted by the IL&FS \nwas not honoured and out of the amount of Rs.111.36 crores, only an \namount of Rs.28 crores was paid.  It was contemplated that on breach of \nsettlement, the entire amount shall become due, hence, the total amount \ncalled upon the CD to make was Rs.257,43,12,692/-.  It is submitted that \nthe CD has not even denied the fact that it has submitted a settlement \nproposal itself and has acknowledged the debt.  It is submitted that under \nSection 7 proceedings, the Adjudicating Authority has only to find out as \nto whether there is ‘debt’ and ‘default’.  The present is a case where ‘debt’ \nand ‘default’ is proved.  Hence, the Adjudicating Authority has rightly \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n10\nadmitted Section 7 Application, which need no interference in the present \nAppeal.\n11.\nWe have heard learned Counsel for the parties on 17.04.2025 in the \nAppeal  as  well  as  Application  for  interim  relief.   By  our  order  dated \n26.03.2025, we directed following:\n“26.03.2025: This appeal has been filed against the order initiating \nCIRP  on  25.02.2025.  Shri  Gopal  Jain  appears  for  the  IL&FS \nFinancial Services Ltd/ Financial Creditors. Ld. Counsel for the \nLucknow  Development  Authority  and  other  Development \nAuthorities submits that they have also stake in the matter and \nthey should be permitted to intervene. Ld. Counsel appearing for \nHomebuyer also seeks liberty to file an intervention application. We \npermit  Lucknow  Development  Authority  and  other  Development \nAuthorities  as  well  as  Homebuyers  to  file  an  intervention \napplication along with affidavit within a week from today. \n \nShri  Gopal  Jain,  counsel  appearing  for  IL&FS  Financial \nServices Ltd. may file Reply to the appeal within two weeks. \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins) No. 500 of 2025 \n \nShri Gopal Jain, Counsel appears for the IL&FS Financial \nServices. Reply, if any, be filed before the next date. Intervention \napplication be served on both Appellant as well as IL&FS Financial \nServices. \n \nList these appeals on 15.04.2025 for admission/ disposal.”\n12.\nIn  these  two  Appeal(s),  the  order  under  challenge  is  an  order \nadmitting Section 7 Application filed by the Financial Creditor  - IL&FS \nFinancial Services Ltd..  As noted above, various Intervention Applications \nhave been filed in these Appeal(s), which include the Applications filed by \ndifferent Development Authorities, the UP Awas Evam Vikas Parishad, \nUP-RERA  and  the  Homebuyers.  Some  Homebuyers  have  filed  the \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n11\nApplications before the Adjudicating Authority for intervention, which was \nrejected.   The  facts,  which  have  been  brought  on  the  record  by  the \nIntervenors, specially Development Authorities, indicate that the CD with \ndifferent  Development  Authorities  has  entered  into  MoU(s)  and \nDevelopment  Agreements.  The  Development  Authorities  have  provided \nland by acquiring land under the Land Acquisition Act as well as  U.P. \nZamindari  Abolition  and  Land  Reforms  Act,  1950,  which  lands  were \nhanded over to the CD for implementing the Hi-Tech Township as per the \npolicy of the State Government.  In the Development Agreements entered \nwith Lucknow Development Authority, there was clause, which we have \nalready noticed above, which provided that if the CD being unable to carry \nout the Project, the Development Authority shall complete the Project with \nregard to 25% land under the Project and performance guarantee has \nbeen given by the CD and in event the Project is not completed, the \nDevelopment Authorities are entitled to sale 25% of total saleable land. \nWe  have  already  noted  Clause-8  of  Development  Agreement  on \n18.11.2016 above. \n13.\nInsofar as two CIRPs, which had commenced against the CD with \nregard to two separate Projects, i.e.  Fernhill Project, Gurgaon and Serene \nResidency Group Housing Project at Greater Noida, the CIRP against the \nCD have been confined to the said Projects, which is apparent from the \norders passed by the NCLT placed before us.  Learned Counsel appearing \nfor  the  Appellant  in  Company  Appeal  (AT)  (Ins.)  No.502  of  2025  has \nsubmitted that the said two Projects be kept out of the present CIRP, \nsince for those Projects, separate CIRP(s) have been initiated and now \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n12\nhave been completed by approval of the Plan by the CoC.  We, thus, are of \nthe view that the Project Fernhill and Serene Residency Group Housing \nwith regard to which separate CIRP(s) have been initiated, in which Plans \nhave been approved, shall be kept out of the present CIRP.  We direct \naccordingly.\n14.\nWith  regard  to  the  submissions  of  the  Appellant(s)  and  the \nHomebuyers that Resolution of the CD can be achieved only by Project-\nwise Resolution or by adopting reverse CIRP, the said submissions need \nto  be  considered  after  pleadings  are  exchanged  between  the  parties. \nLearned Counsel for the LDA, further submitted that although the LDA \nhas filed its claim as a Financial Creditor  by submitting claim in Form-C, \nbut LDA has not been included in the Committee of Creditors (“CoC”) and \nit  is  submitted  that  it  has  been  only  informed  to  participate  in  the \nMeetings  of  the  CoC  as  an  Observer.   Learned  Counsel  for  the  LDA \nsubmitted that LDA is a Financial Creditor  and also a Secured Creditor of \nthe  CD.   Similar  submissions  have  been  raised  on  behalf  of  other \nDevelopment  Authorities,  who  claimed  to  be  Financial  Creditors  and \nSecured Creditors of the CD.  \n15.\nThe CoC having been constituted, we are of the view that with \nregard to issue that LDA and other Development Authorities are Financial \nCreditors/ Secured Creditors, the Development Authorities have to file an \nappropriate Application before the Adjudicating Authority.  We grant the \nliberty  to  all  Development  Authorities,  who  had  entered  into  MoU(s)/ \nDevelopment Agreements with the CD to file an Application (who has filed \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n13\nclaims before the RP) before the Adjudicating Authority regarding the \ngrievance of their categorisation in the CIRP.\n16.\nThe  CIRP  having  been  commenced  by  admission  of  Section  7 \nApplication and the CoC has already been constituted, we are of the view \nthat RP may proceed in the process by collating/ verifying the claims of all \nCreditors.  \n17.\nRegulation 36A, sub-regulation (1) as amended on 15.02.2024 is as \nfollows: \n“36A. Invitation for expression of interest. (1) The resolution \nprofessional  shall  publish  brief  particulars  of  the  invitation  for \nexpression of interest in Form G of the Schedule-I at the earliest, \nnot  later  than  sixtieth  day  from  the  insolvency  commencement \ndate, from interested and eligible prospective resolution applicants \nto submit resolution plans. \n \nClarification: The resolution professional after the approval \nof the committee may invite a resolution plan for each real estate \nproject or group of projects of the corporate debtor.”\n18.\nThe above Regulation permits Resolution Professional (“RP”) after \nthe approval of CoC to invite the Resolution Plan for each real estate \nproject or group of project of the CD.\n19.\nThe Financial Creditor  having initiated CIRP for its dues, which \nCIRP has been admitted, the Financial Creditor  is entitled for its claim in \nthe CIRP.  However, all the steps need to be taken for Resolution of the \nCD in view of the fact that several Projects are situated at different cities \nof the Uttar Pradesh, which Projects were approved under the Hi-Tech \nTownship Policy of the Sate of UP.  The State/ Development Authorities \nprovided huge lands to the CD for carrying out the Hi-Tech Township \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n14\nProjects.  The present is not only a case of CIRP of a real estate company, \nbut  involves  large  number  of  stakeholders  including  Development \nAuthorities, Homebuyers and Financial Creditors and other Creditors.\n20.\nThe submissions raised by learned Counsel for the parties makes \nout prima  facie case  for  issue  of  notice  and  to  make  an  interim \narrangement and to pass an interim order for protecting the interest of all \nstakeholders.  \n21.\nIssue Notice.  Let reply be filed within two weeks and rejoinder \nthereafter in one week.  List these Appeal(s) for disposal on 20.05.2025 \nat 02:00 PM.\n22.\nIntervention Application(s) filed by Development Authorities/ UP-\nRERA/ UP Awas Evam Vikas Parishad and the Homebuyers, as noted \nabove are allowed.  Intervenors are also allowed two weeks time to file \naffidavit in support of their case.  \n23.\nAs noted above, keeping in view the issue pertaining to mode and \nmanner  of  the  resolution  of  CD  and  enormity  of  Projects,  which  are \nsituated in different cities being involved, we need to hear the parties \nbefore issuing any direction with regard to manner in which Resolution of \nthe CD shall proceed as per the provisions of the IBC.  At this stage, we \nissue following directions:\n(1)\nLucknow  Development  Authority  and  other \nDevelopment  Authorities  are  given  liberty  to  file  an \nApplication with regard to categorisation of their claims \nbefore  the  Adjudicating  Authority,  which  may  be \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.) Nos. 500 & 502 of 2025          \n15\nconsidered  and  decided  at  an  early  date  by  the \nAdjudicating Authority.\n(2)\nThe  IRP/ RP shall proceed to collate and verify  the \nclaims  of  Creditors  in  accordance  with  the  CIRP \nRegulations, 2016.  \nTill the next date of hearing, CIRP may go on, however, \nno Form-G shall be issued in the CIRP of the CD. \nParties  may  complete  the  pleadings  before  the  next \ndate.\n[Justice Ashok Bhushan]\nChairperson\n[Arun Baroka] \nMember (Technical) \nNEW DELHI\nAshwani \nCompany Appeal (AT) (Ins.)

P. Chitale & Co. \nChartered Accountants \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section \n143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors' \nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results section of our report. We are \nindependent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the \nStandalone Financial Results, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with \nthese requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \nManagement and Board of Directors' Responsibility for the Audited Standalone Financial Results \nThese Standalone Financial Results have been compiled from the annual Standalone Financial Statements \nand approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The Board of Directors are responsible for the \npreparation of these Standalone Financial Results that give a true and fair view of the net profit for the \nquarter and net profit for the year and other financial information in accordance with the recognition \nand measurement principles laid down in Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, \nread with Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, as amended to the extent applicable, the \nrelevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI guidelines and other accounting \nprinciples generally accepted in India and in compliance with the Listing Regulations. This responsibility \nalso includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act, \nBanking Regulation Act, 1949 and RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for \npreventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate \naccounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, \nimplementation and maintenance of adequate \ninternal \nfinancial controls that were operating \neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the \npreparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Results that give a true and fair view and are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Results, the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the \nBank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern \nand using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate \nthe Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThe Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process. \nAuditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Results as a \nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' \nort that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee \nt an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it \nts. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \n2 \nKalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP \nChartered Accountants \nM. P. Chitale & Co. \nChartered Accountants \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of these Standalone Financial Results. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional \nskepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n• \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Results, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, \nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one \nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n• \nObtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design \naudit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, \nwe are also responsible for expressing our opinion through a separate report on whether the \nBank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial \nStatements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. \n• \nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. \n• \nConclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of \naccounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists \nrelated to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue \nas a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw \nattention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Results \nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the \naudit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or \nconditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern. \n• \nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Results, \nincluding the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Results represent the \nunderlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned \nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in \ninternal control that we identify during our audit. \ne also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant \nthical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships \n3 \nKalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP \nChartered Accountants \nM. P. Chitale & Co. \nChartered Accountants \nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related \nsafeguards. \nOther Matters \n1. The Standalone Financial Results include the results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 being \nthe balancing figure between the audited figures in respect of the financial year ended March \n31, 2025 and the published unaudited year to date figures up to the third quarter of the current \nfinancial year which were subject to limited review by us .. \n2. The Standalone Financial Results of the Bank for the previous year ended March 31, 2024 were \naudited by one continuing auditor and one predecessor auditor.

You have seen it in gas, oil, you have seen it in gasoline. You \nhave seen it in ATF. You have also seen it in polymer, polyester. Oil and gas demand has \nbeen good. Retail has been actually in some ways mixed. First half was slow.  \n \nAlso, if you recall, we had three full quarters of significant streamlining and rationalization that \nwe did, and beginning last quarter and more importantly this quarter you can see the pick-up \nin EBITDA. And second half also benefited from Mahakumbh and festive demand.  \n \nJio is in a very strong performance - customer additions, 5G subscribers, the ARPU going up \nand we did not lose customers, or we did not lose the intensity of data consumption too. The \nfull year if you look at it, when I say energy here, I have taken O2C and upstream as part of \nthe 8% number.  \n \nWe saw that, weaker cracks, polyester, to a great extent negated by a lot of things that we \ndid on feedstock optimization. Domestic push has been a big standout, and I have a few \nslides on A, our market share, and B, what has been the growth in volumes there. Overall, I \nthink the other point I would definitely flag is when you look at the O2C or energy performance \nin the context of how other global refineries have performed or standalone petrochemical \nmanufacturers or even actually integrated players. If you see the numbers, it is absolutely \nstandout in terms of our performance. So that is how EBITDA was lower by 8%.  \n \nJio platforms up 17% on the back of, of course, the leadership in technology, the number of \ncustomers added the ARPU increase, and now we are the world's largest data company and \nhave 191 million 5G subscribers and ARPU at ₹ 206 plus at 13.5%. \n \nOn retail I talked to you about the first half being soft and all the efforts on streamlining and \nrationalizations of stores, etc., and the third and fourth quarter has been pretty good. And \n \n \n \n \n3 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nalso, all the operating metrics in terms of transactions, in terms of number of customers, all \nof them holding pretty well. And a lot of focus on quick commerce and Dinesh will talk to you \nabout what we are doing on quick commerce.  \n \nAnd of course, on JioStar, the effective date was somewhere in November. It is the largest \nmedia and entertainment company in India. Again, I do not want to steal the thunder of Kevin, \nbut 280 million subscribers and I think I just like the statistics on 61 million live concurrency. \nI think it means a lot in the context of what you have seen even globally. And Kevin do talk \nabout this when he presents. So these are the overall numbers on a full year basis, revenue \nup 7%, but obviously muted on EBITDA and PAT and we talked about O2C's performance \nthere.  \n \nWhen you look at each of, obviously the consumer business fully offset the weakness there. \nWhen you look at the PAT numbers for each of the entities, you can see JPL at ₹ 26,000 \ncrore, it is up 22% and RRVL almost ₹ 12,400 crore, up 11%. RIL stand-alone impacted \nbecause of O2C. \n \nHere is the balance sheet. So it has been a flat net debt environment and look at the capex \nversus our cash profits. Clearly, we continue to be below and all the numbers are pretty \nhealthy there and allows us to invest. For the quarter revenues were up about 9% and \nEBITDA 4% up and again, PAT 6.4. Broad story on margins and when we talk about OTC, \nwe will see that there has been this broader compression on deltas across transportation, \nfuel, and polymer and also maybe not on the polymer side, definitely has been weak. And big \noffsets with Jio on with up 18% and retail up 14%. Oil and gas was impacted with lower \nproduction. \n \nWith this Anshuman. \n \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur 00:06:44 – 00:21:15 (Jio Platforms) \n \nThanks Srikanth. \n \nGood evening everyone. \n \nWelcome to the physical analyst meet. An update on the performance of Jio platforms. Strong \nrevenue and EBITDA growth. This was a combination of both the tariff impact flowing through \nbut in addition a lot of success that we are seeing with our home rollout, home broadband \nrollout, both combination of fiber, but more importantly fixed wireless and I'll speak a bit more \n \n \n \n \n4 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nabout that. Consolidated operating revenues for the full year at ₹ 1,28,218 crore and EBITDA \nat ₹ 64,170, so roughly around 17 to 18% growth. For the quarter, the consolidated revenue \nwas very close to ₹ 34,000 crore. The total subscriber base at 488.2 million, so that is a net \naddition of 6.1 million for the quarter. So the little bit of impact that we saw a couple of quarters \nago when tariffs were raised, well and truly back, is behind us and we are now adding \nsubscribers. We are seeing good traction on the ground and also seeing very good \nconsumption trends on the ground.  \n \nARPUs at ₹ 206.2 so a little bit of flow through of the tariff increase and also some bit of more \ndata consumption in this quarter. Data traffic on the network grew 20% year on year to 49 \nexabytes in this quarter. So we continue to break all records for data consumption and this is \nnot only Indian records but global records. The growing 5G subscriber mix as well as the \nhome connects all adding to the data traffic growth. \n \nAlso, we are seeing good traction with digital revenues as well, digital service revenues on \nthe back of Cloud services which are now launched for enterprises. We have won some good \ncompetitive tenders for government clients and then a bunch of services around IoT that we \nprovide and also the content bundling that we do for services provided to our home \ncustomers. So a whole lot of initiatives leading to this strong financial and operating \nperformance and I will speak through some of those. \n \nMobility, our lead, our success in the 5G deployment and now 5G consumption and \ncustomers' uptake of 5G is very clearly visible on the ground. This map from Ookla shows \nagain we have pretty much pan India 5G coverage now. We cover most of our customers \nand we have been able to transition 191 million users to 5G, which is the largest base outside \nof China, and if you recollect the last quarter itself we had spoken about how we are now the \nworld's largest data company in terms of overall data consumption and we continue to be \nthat, ahead of companies from China as well, bigger than China Mobile. 5G traffic as a \npercentage of total traffic has been growing, so we are now at 45% of total wireless traffic is \non 5G, and this continues to grow and data consumption is continuing to grow, and we are \nseeing the per capita consumption for consumers when on 5G network is significantly higher. \n \nSo people are finding the usage to use more data, and we believe that is sticky kind of usage \nand that will give us the ability to monetize that more as we go forward. We have really not \nstarted monetizing 5G. So effectively, 45% of data that people today are consuming is being \noffered to them free of cost. They become eligible to use that data, but after that they are not \nreally paying for it, but they are getting into the habit of consuming content, consuming data, \nbut they are not paying for it but they are getting into the habit of consuming content, \nconsuming data, consuming 5G services, and we believe that is a very big opportunity for us \n \n \n \n \n5 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nin the same way that LTE was a big opportunity for us in 2016. The fact that that differentiated \nLTE data capacity creation that we had done, which subsequently led to the revenue market \nshare, finally it has to reflect at some point in time. We are seeing a similar trend now \nbeginning to emerge here. And we see this as a massive opportunity as far as wireless \nservices are concerned, and even home broadband services are concerned. And at these \nscales, where 191 million users, 45% of data traffic on the network, we are able to give 224 \nmbps 5G download experience. The overall download experience across all the tests that we \ndo and then external agencies do, they have all been very positive. The customer user \nexperience has been extremely positive on the 5G network. Despite the growth in traffic, we \nhave been holding up quite well. \n \nA case study, an example of that was the Mahakumbh, which I am sure all of you are familiar \nwith. This was over 660 million devotees gathering within 40 square kilometers in 45 days. \nAnd the way our network held up, and we did put in a lot of effort to make sure that the \nnetwork held up during those 45 days in the Mahakumbh. It was the densest data \nconsumption, population conversion that anybody had ever seen globally. We were working \nwith our vendors, with our partners, and they were tracking the data usage as well, and it was \nmind-boggling for all of them. Nobody anywhere in the globe had ever seen something like \nthis. There were limited access zones, there were jammers put all across, but we still had to \nmake sure that people were able to consume as much data that they wanted and they were \nonline all the time. A big difference we saw here, the uplink traffic used to be quite high. So \na lot of people were uploading videos and pictures and normally that is not the way you plan \nyour network. You would expect downlink to be much more. And we had to therefore adjust \nsome of this there on the ground, on the site. We were able to, with our spectrum that we \nhave, but the government had given us some spectrum during that period to just provide \nservices to the customers, we were able to test the elasticity of that network, really, in that \nsmall period or small space where we saw 2.2 million GB of data traffic, bulk of the usage of \n5G, so the whole area was enabled with 5G. We were giving download and upload speeds \nof 200 mbps plus, 141 million voice minutes. So this has kind of become a case study for \nnetwork companies, telecom companies, service providers, vendors, everybody is looking at \nthis as a case study where these kind of global records were set in a short period of time. \nAnd we learned a lot. \n \nTo now sweat the assets on our network much more, the deployment that we have already \ndone, plus with the spectrum that we have got, the network is fairly elastic. We can keep \nadding more customers with tweaks to the network, being able to track where the data \nconsumption, or where the consumption is, where the users are. The elasticity of this network \nis fairly high. That gives us confidence that with the network that we have already created, \nwe can serve hundreds of millions more customers on this network. We feel reasonably \n \n \n \n \n6 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nconfident about that. The fixed wireless stack, now this is something that we have been \ndeploying extensively on the ground, as you are aware about this. The recent TIA report said \nthat we have 85% market share in this. \n \nIn this particular product which has gone live in the market over the last few months, we have \nbeen deploying a fair bit of fixed wireless, both on our 5G spectrum but also on the UBR. We \nhave developed or now deployed, not only developed, so it is in commercial use, the first \npoint-to-point wireless solution for fixed wireless. So this is not point-to-point. In the way the \nnetwork is configured, we can use single radiating equipment to serve multiple customers. \nWe have been able to, through that, reduce the cost of deployment. So the cost that we incur \nto connect every new home is incrementally much lesser than what you would hear about \ncompanies elsewhere which are doing such a thing. The spectral efficiency is higher. And we \nhave been able to create the full mapping of the country where our customers are. This is a \nvery important functionality. So when we get a customer inquiry or a customer request to \nconnect a customer, we know exactly which way, which technology to use, which site to \nradiate from for a particular customer. If the fiber is available, of course we connect the \ncustomer with fiber, but otherwise with our 5G spectrum, in some cases UBR, we know \nexactly, it is pretty 3 meter x 3 meter map, where we know exactly what kind of throughput \ndifferent technologies will provide to customers. And that is very powerful on the ground when \nthe implementation is going on, when the network engineers have to be on the ground \nconnecting new homes and new premises. And all of this is being done completely end to \nend value chain is in our control, be it the devices, the technology, deployment, all of that has \nbeen done in-house. So we are not taking this technology or taking any equipment. Now, \npretty much all the equipment is being manufactured, produced by ourselves within the \necosystem. They have been designed ourselves and they have been produced in India, all \nof this is made in India, and being done completely within the Jio ecosystem. As a result of \nwhich, we are feeling confident to be able to connect 100 million homes, which is a target \nthat we have set for ourselves. \n \nIn the last six months, we have had 90% of industry net ads, 5x higher than the next nearest \ncompetitor. So the chart on the right top that you see is the number of AirFiber subscribers, \nbasically the fixed wireless subscribers. We call it AirFiber because unlike traditional definition \nof fixed wireless, in our case, we are giving completely synchronous uplink, downlink, and \nthroughputs because of the way the network is configured, because of the spectrum that we \nare using. So when we say 1 Gbps at home for home broadband using either our 5G \nspectrum or the UBR, that is uplink and downlink of 1 Gbps. That is what we have enabled, \nwhich is reflecting in the ramp-up of AirFiber subscribers. In the recent months, we have also \ntransitioned from the 5G spectrum to UBR. \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nUBR is now commercially live, even in situations where we do not have direct line of sight \nwhich has been a bug challenge just about every operator globally. We are able to do without \nnano site connections as well by reflecting the radio from other surfaces. This is unique. This \nis proprietary and we have been doing this successfully and commercially, so it is all \ncommercially deployed on the ground. The chart at the bottom is not supposed to be pacman, \nbut we have good lead over the others in the industry. \n \nThis is the other deployment which is now being done successfully, commercially on the \nground, which is our private 5G instances for enterprise customers. As you can see, the \nnetwork is the same, but we are able to create a dedicated slice for use cases for enterprises, \nfor whatever the end use case may be, including for fixed wireless. We have a network slice \nthat we use to provide that service. And then create a secure tunnel on our own private 5G \ncore. As you know, we have spoken about this in the past that our 5G core, the whole network \ncore, 4G and 5G core is completely deployed by us. It is our own proprietary core. And we \nare able to create private instance of that for our enterprise customers. And this has got many \nuse cases. We already have deployed in some of the industrial situations, industrial premises, \nincluding in Jamnagar, and use cases around robotic automation, video surveillance, \nenhanced security. \n \nWe are able to give ultra-reliable, low latency network. We are able to do network slicing to \nensure consistent service delivery irrespective of the amount of load that the network may \nhave at any point in time, and able to provide end-to-end managed services. With those few \nupdates around stuff that we are doing on technology and the progress we have made over \nthe last few months, especially on 5G and the home and home deployment, coming to the \nkey operating matrices for the business, the subscriber base, as I said, has grown to 488.2 \nmillion, so that was a net addition of 6.1 million during the quarter. ARPU went up to 206.2, \nand remember this is a shortened quarter, so in that sense the growth is a little bit more than \nthat in percentage terms. The average data consumption continues to grow, 33.6 GB per \nuser per month, and seeing a lot of traction in these seasons currently as well. \n \nOverall data and voice traffic grew by 19.5% and 3.8% year on year respectively. Coming to \nthe revenue numbers, these are the RJIL quarterly financials, which grew to 30,018 crore in \nterms of revenues and 16,188 crore in EBITDA. That is close to 54% EBITDA margin for our \nconnectivity business and the growth has been fairly steady and continuous. And the full year \nnumbers for the connectivity business, RJIL, we ended the year at ₹ 1,14,000 crore of \noperating revenues and EBITDA of ₹ 61,233 crore, so both growing in the 14 to 16% range \nand again fairly steady and healthy growth delivered across the years over last several years. \nThe consolidated financials for Jio Platforms Limited, the first three columns are quarterly \nand then the full year numbers on the right two columns. Full year fiscal 2025 revenue and \n \n \n \n \n8 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nEBITDA growth of 17%, consistent EBITDA margins of 50% and this is after a whole bunch \nof initiatives that are currently being taken to grow our digital services or other service \nofferings that we are going to provide to customers, we are maintaining our EBITDA margin \nat 50%. Q4 revenues at ₹ 33,986 crore consol revenues, which is again close to 18% year-\non-year growth, and EBITDA at ₹ 17,000 crore, and profit after tax growth of 26% to ₹ 7,023 \ncrore. This was for the quarter Q4. \n \nWith that, I am going to hand over to Dinesh to give an update on the retail business. \n \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja 00:21:19 – 00:37:20 (Reliance Retail) \n \nHi, good evening, everyone. We will cover the business update on retail. \n \nSo if you look at the performance highlights, we had a very strong quarter with 16% growth \non a Y-o-Y basis. The revenue for full year was up 8% because the first half was slightly \nweak, but the second half, last quarter was good growth and even this quarter we have done \nvery well. Overall EBITDA grew at 9% for the full year, for the quarter it was 14%. EBITDA \nmargin from operations continues to expand; it was up 20 basis points on Y-o-Y basis. On \nthe quick commerce side, we continued to expand our hyper local deliveries. The number of \norders were up quarter-on-quarter 2.4 times. So that is a pretty significant scale-up that we \nhave been able to do in the last quarter. \n \nConsumer brands business is the fastest growing FMCG business in India. We have \nachieved almost ₹ 11,450 crore of sales in the second year of operations. We also did the \ncommercial launch of SHEIN with the vision of providing global fashion to every Indian at \naffordable prices. It is live across app, website, as well as we have a shop-in-shop on our Jio. \nMore than 12,000 options are already available on the platform and we are scaling up the \nvendor ecosystem to have very quick launch, very quickly large number of options on the \nplatform. We opened 2,659 stores during the year. We continue to expand stores across the \nportfolio. We are also pretty much done with the streamlining that we had started during the \nyear. So our net addition is about 500 stores and we are pretty much more or less done with \nthe streamlining now. \n \nAll our operating metrics, whether it is number of transactions, the registered customers, \neverything continues to grow in double digits. So overall a pretty healthy quarter. If we look \nat the breakup, revenue was up 16% for the quarter on a Y-o-Y basis. EBITDA from \noperations was up 15%, total EBITDA was up 14% and profit after tax was up 30%. When \nyou look at it on a full year basis, the revenue was up 8%, EBITDA from operations was up \n \n \n \n \n9 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n9%, and profit after tax was up 12%. So we have almost crossed 25,000 crore in EBITDA for \nthe full year, and 12,400 crore of PAT. Moving on to business updates across each of the \nbusinesses.  \n \nThe consumer electronics business, we had pretty healthy mid-single-digit growth like for like \ngrowth. The average bill values continues to grow. The average bill values were up 26% on \na Y-o-Y basis. Also we see our conversions improving substantially. There was a 200 basis \npoints improvement in conversions. With the early onset of summers, we saw very strong \ngrowth in sales of ACs. Even this quarter, April, has been pretty warm, and there is a \nprediction of this being a pretty hot summer, so AC will continue to grow rapidly.  \n \nOur rescue business, we had a 13% Y-o-Y on the growth in terms of the number of customers \nserved. We also continue to expand the number of service centres we have, as well as we \nlaunched the on-demand warranty services last three quarters back, so that is again \nsomething we are expanding. We have now launched out on-demand warranty services to \nmore than 300 cities.  \n \nGMD, which is our B2B and B2C business in electronics, it had a very healthy growth of 76% \non a Y-o-Y basis. We continued to expand our reach in terms of the merchant base, as well \nas expand the width of participation, right. So how many retailers are participating, how much \nthey are buying from us, all those metrics are showing a pretty healthy upswing.  \n \nOur own brands business, where we sell our own brands, not just in our stores, but even in \nthe distribution channel, that business, again, continues to grow very steadily. The business \nwas up 30% on a Y-o-Y basis. We are expanding the reach of the business. The merchant \nbase was up 60% on a Y-o-Y basis.  \n \nWe launched several new products across multiple brands, multiple categories to plug the \ngaps, as well as new features. There are some products where we are bringing new features \nto the market. These are the first in the market. And compared with the price value \nproposition, they are finding very strong uptick with the consumers.  \n \nOn the fashion lifestyle side, while the first half was weak, the business has really turned \naround very well. We had positive LFLs during the quarter. The performance was quite \nsteady, led by the wedding season and festivals. We have been working on repositioning \nsome of our formats. So Trends, we did a large campaign, New Times, New Trends to really \nreposition the format within the younger audience, as well as the family audience. AZORTE, \nwhich is a Gen Z focused, tech enabled format, there we again did our targeted campaign \nwith a couple of celebrities. \n \n \n \n \n10 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nSo the effort is to establish these brands and have top of mind recall for the gen Z customers. \nIn addition, we are upgrading our stores. So Trends 3.0, which we have talked about, which \nis an upgraded version of our Trends store, are more digitally enabled version. So that is \nsomething we are scaling up. We are renovating a lot of our stores to upgrade them to have \nthe latest technology. And also support that with better in-store experience, not just in terms \nof technology, which is available, but in terms of number of options people see.  \n \nSo we have moved on with Project Impetus, which we have talked about in the past, where \nwe are talking of a design-to-shelf cycle of 30 days. We are now doing weekly refreshes in \nthe store, so every time a customer walks in, they get a certain percentage of options which \nare new. Also, we have kind of optimized the number of options which are available so the \nstores are less crowded and they look much more attractive. Now, as a result, our sales are \ngoing up while the inventory is going down. So that is a very good sign for the business. We \nhave also spent a lot of effort on improving the design quotient of our products and our own \nbrands. The contribution was up 900 basis points on a Y-o-Y basis. Specifically, some of our \nlarge and well-known brands, including NetPlay and Avaasa, they were the best performers \nduring the quarter. \n \nMoving on to our online fashion businesses, Ajio delivered a very steady quarter. We continue \nto increase the average bill values, as well as add new customers. We added 1.9 million new \ncustomers during the quarter, which is in line with what we have been adding almost every \nquarter. The number of options available on the platform now is 2.4 million, up 44% on a Y-\no-Y. External brands are the ones which drive traffic onto the platform, so their share was up \n11% and our focus continues to bring more and more exclusive and external brands which \nare able to get the customer pull and drive traffic onto the platform. We have also launched \nsame day and next day delivery across 26 cities. So we are increasing the speed at which \nwe are able to deliver the products. One big benefit of that is the returns are directly correlated \nas your time to delivery goes down, returns goes down and we are seeing that very clearly in \nour data.  \n \nThe All-Star Sale, which is a flagship event for March. In March, most of the online platforms \ngo on sale. This is the time where we acquire a lot of customers. We had a big event, and we \nadded 6 lakh plus new customers during this campaign. We talked about the SHEIN launch, \nwhich we have done during the quarter as well.  \n \nOn the premium brand side, the focus is growing the omni channel presence, a lot of bridge \nto luxury brands customers do not necessarily always prefer to come to the store. They want \nto come to you. So there is a meaningful 8% contribution that is coming from out-of-store \n \n \n \n \n11 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nselling. So we are basically going to the customer's home or letting them order online, and \nthen we are delivering to their homes. So that is seeing a very good acceptance amongst the \ncustomers, and this part is becoming quite meaningful. \n \nWe launched another very interesting accessible luxury ready to wear women's brand, a \nFrench brand called Maje during the quarter. We have launched our first store in Jio World \nDrive.  \n \nOn Vision Express, which is our JV with EssilorLuxottica in the eyewear space, we've kind of \nre-pivoted the go-to-market strategy. We are launching global new concept stores, as well as \nrenovating a lot of existing stores and the product offering in order to really scale up this \nbusiness. There is a large market opportunity here.  \n \nAjio Luxe which is the largest platform for luxury and premium brands, we continue to add \nnew brands and new options into the portfolio. The total count of brands now there is about \n800. The option was up 19% on a Y-o-Y basis.  \n \nOn the jewels business, we had steady growth led by increase in average bill values. As you \nare aware, the gold prices have increased substantially, which has had an impact on the \naverage bill values, which are up almost 20% on Y-o-Y basis. Our differentiator has been \nlaunched targeted campaigns, which are collections which target specific occasions, design \nthat offering. That continues to do well.  \n \nWe have developed a number of properties over the last several years, and some of those \ncollections like Valentine’s Day, Hoop and Bali collections were very well received during the \nquarter.  \n \nGrocery was the star performer during this quarter with the highest growth. The stores \nbusiness continues to outperform with industry-leading performance. \n \nSome of the premium formats, including Freshpik and Gofresh, where we provide \ndifferentiated assortment and shopping experience, are finding very good acceptance. And \nin the affluent areas, we are launching more and more premium stores. The growth was quite \nbroad based across categories. The general merchandise and value apparel have a \nmeaningful contribution, especially in our big buck stores. And they are a big driver of margin. \nAlso, there is strong demand for niche and premium products. These are the products which \ndrive a lot of footfall into the stores, especially the younger customers, because these brands \nare not available anywhere else. We are able to take them to pan India, and it is a win-win \n \n \n \n \n12 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nfor the brand, as well as for the customer and for us it drives a lot of traffic, especially the \nyounger ones, into the stores.  \n \nThe B2B business metro continues to have steady growth, again, pretty broad-based growth \nacross categories.  \n \nOne of the segments that we have identified within B2B is the HoReCa segment, where we \nare putting a lot of focus that segment had a 37% growth on a Y-o-Y basis.  \n \nJioMart it has basically three services. There is an under-30-minute quick service. There is a \nscheduled delivery, where the assortment is much wider, and then there is subscription \nservice, where you can subscribe and every day you get, depending on the frequency you \nchoose, we deliver the goods at your home early morning. All three are picking up very well. \nThe average daily orders were up 62% on a Y-o-Y basis. Specifically our under 30-minute \noffering, which has the widest network reach. We have almost 2,000 plus stores which are \non the network, covering more than 4,000 plus pin codes. So this is much wider reach than \nany other quick commerce player. We have kind of re-pivoted our model completely to under \n30 minutes delivery.  \n \nAnd we are seeing very strong traction with a 2.4X quarter and quarter growth in daily exit \norders. And this number will scale up substantially in the coming year as well. We are also \nnow starting to proactively market this proposition, our proposition of no hidden charges, \nquick delivery, and no delivery fees continues to resonate very well with the customers. We \nalso launched the quick and scheduled tabs if you go to the JioMart app. There are two \nseparate tabs. So that customer is very clear what is available under 30 minutes. So that \nassortment under 30 minutes if you want, there is that assortment which gets delivered from \nthe nearest store that is what you see. If you choose scheduled delivery, you get a much \nwider assortment and you can get the delivery for those the next day they may come from a \nwarehouse or from a 3P seller. So that proposition is very clear for the customer. The big \nadvantage that we have in this segment is compared to other people who have to set up \ndedicated store infrastructure. For us, we are only leveraging the infrastructure that we \nalready have. My fixed cost is already being taken care of by my store sales. This is all \nincremental sales and it is only incremental cost that I have to incur to deliver these orders. \nSo we are doing this model in a profitable manner with a very strong unit economics.  \n \nIn addition to our 1P offerings, 3P seller base, in order to plug the gaps, we continue to add \n3P sellers onto the platform. The number of 3P sellers was up 22% on a Y-o-Y basis. Live \nselection was up 10% on a Y-o-Y basis. Similarly, our subscription service continues to see \n \n \n \n \n13 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nstrong growth. We had a 27% growth Y-o-Y on daily orders and 37% growth in apps and web \nvisits. \n \nConsumer brands, it is on a very, very exciting trajectory, the business is growing from \nstrength to strength. We did almost ₹ 11,500 crore of turnover during the year. More than \n60% of that comes from general trade, so the brands are very, very widely distributed. If we \nlook at some of our key brands, like Campa and Independence, they are all growing very \nrapidly. Campa has already gained double-digit market share in the key markets where we \nare available. We also continue to add to our portfolio by launching new products and \nacquiring new interesting brands. Some of the notable acquisitions we have done in the year \ninclude SIL, Velvet, which is a personal care brand, and Tags. We have also launched several \nnew products. So with Campa, we have launched Campa Energy. And with Muttiah \nMuralitharan, we have launched a new sports drink called Spinner. Our distribution network \nis already quite wide, and it is expanding pretty rapidly as well. We are present across 1 \nmillion plus retail outlets through a network of 3,200 plus distributors. \n \nIn addition to tapping the Indian market, we have also started looking at exports to other \nmarkets, and we would basically start at that, and we would set up distribution in select \nmarkets to really distribute our products where they have the relevant appeal in a pretty big \nway. That is the update on the retail business. Now I will hand over to Kevin for the JioStar \nbusiness. \n \n \nSh Kevin Vaz 00:37:27 – 00:45:55 (JioStar) \n \nThank you and good evening everyone. \n \nOur business at JioStar is barely five months old. So what I am going to do is I am going to \nshare with you what we have been up to for the last five months. I hope each and every one \nof you all have downloaded the Jio Hotstar app and are enjoying it. \n \nJust to give you a perspective, this was coming together of two iconic brands, Viacom 18 and \nDisney Star. And on today's date, we have created India's largest media and entertainment \nplatform. This platform is built on three business units. The digital entertainment business, \nthe sports unit, and the TV broadcast. I will talk to each of them. If I look at the digital \nentertainment platform, within a short period of three months, we went and launched \nJioHotstar, the merger got completed on November 14th. On February 14th is when we went \nand launched JioHotstar. And we transferred a robust library of 320,000 hours of content onto \nthe platform. \n \n \n \n \n14 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nIn addition, we added 250 originals or exclusive titles, which is the highest among any of our \ncontemporaries. And thirdly, and most important thing is this will be the only platform in the \nworld that would have all the biggest American studios to be on a single plot platform where \nyou have their movies and series coming on one single platform whether it is from Marvel to \nHBO whether it is Warner to Disney or it is Peacock to Paramount you will have all the content \non a single platform. \n \nThis platform of ours, when you look at the width of content that we have, actually appeals to \nthe entire family across India. And more important, it is not about reaching out to families \nacross India but within a family, we have content for each and every individual, whether it is \nwhere you have two iconic brands, Disney and Nickelodeon or for the youth kids, where you \nhave two iconic brands, Disney and Nickelodeon or for the youth segment, where we have \nsome of the biggest reality shows or nonfiction shows, whether it is Big Boss, whether it is \nKhatron Ke Khiladi, Coffee with Karan or Laughter Chef on a single platform. For the women \nof the household, we have got some of the most iconic brands whether it is Anupamaa or I \nam saying is if you look at it, it is Mangal Lakshmi okay? And then for the males, we have got \na whole lot of sporting players.  \n \nIf I look at our sports portfolio across TV and digital, we have around about 24 sports \nchannels. And in today's date, we are the home to the best marquee properties on cricket, \nwhether it is ICC, whether it is IPL or BCCI, but also home to the biggest domestic leagues, \nthe Pro Kabaddi League or the Indian Super League, and also high-end sports or premium \nsports, which is the Premier League and Wimbledon. Lastly, on the TV broadcast business, \nwe have a very robust TV broadcast business with over 100 channels in 10 different \nlanguages actually reaching out to around about 358 million viewers every day. \n \nIf I look at it between these businesses, we reach out on a monthly basis to over 800 million \npeople every month. So I spoke a lot about, I am saying, is entertainment I spoke about sports \nbut we at JioStar look at creating delightful experiences for our consumers. And I am saying \non the 26th of Jan is when we started bringing up live experiences, where we started \nstreaming live shows. Coldplay was one example, 100,000 people enjoyed Coldplay live at \nthe Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. What JioHotstar managed to do, is to take this \nto millions of fans, to their living rooms, and let them enjoy the same live experience in their \nliving room across the country. Besides that I am saying is we have gone and done two big \nevents on Mahashivratri and Ram Navami. And if you look at the numbers for each of these, \nwe looked at 82 million views coming up for Ram Navami. We had Ram Navami, which was \nthrough multiple feeds so people could view the arti through multiple feeds not from a single \nlocation. At the same time, they could see something in Ayodhya, Chitrakoot or Panchwati. \n \n \n \n \n15 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nSo now, I am saying all this content, what does it deliver for us? I spoke about the width of \nthe content. These are the numbers, okay? Within a short period of three and a half months, \non today's date, we have got 280 million paid subscribers. Actually, we put this in perspective. \nWe are very close to I am saying is globally we are very close to Netflix, which gets this from \nacross the world. We generate I am saying is we have 503 million I am saying is users who \ncome to our platform on a monthly basis significant of any of our competition. \n \nAnd lastly, as Srikanth was mentioning, if I look during the India-New Zealand final for the \nChampions Trophy, we managed a concurrency, and when I say concurrency, it is people \ncoming and watching at the same time, right? This is a world record where we have 61 million \npeople watching a sport at the same time and that shows the strength of the platform. \n \nIf I have to put it into perspective for you many of us might know of the Super Bowl in the US. \nLet me tell you, their peak concurrency could be one fourth of it. And I think this show that \npeople in spite of having 61 million, we had a seamless, I am saying is viewership for each \nof these consumers that came on. On TV, we have got a 34% market share. And our content \nlibrary of 320,000 hours of content is actually six times that of a Netflix or an Amazon. Just \nfrom an operational point of view, we launched, as I mentioned, we launched JioHotstar app \nwith the best features from both the legacy apps. We seamlessly migrated 500 million-plus \nusers and a massive content library within three months. In TV, we lead in seven out of the \neight markets that we have across the country. And we are clearly focused to be present \nacross a billion screens, whether it is TV, mobile or CTV in this country. On the back of IPL, \nmany people talk about pay television dying in this country, et cetera. But remember, in this \ncountry, pay television is still in excess of 100 million and still growing. During the IPL, in the \nfirst ten days of the IPL, we grew by around 1.5 million I am saying households and we expect \nthat to hit at least three to five by the end of it.  \n \nLastly, I am saying is that is how we are putting this to just translate it. What does all this \nmean into numbers? The biggest part was this merger was consummated in less than nine \nmonths a merger of this scale.  \n \nOur revenue if I have to look at it for the period because it is a very short period I have taken \nfrom the time we launched is 9,497 crore with a EBITDA of 266 crore.  \n \nWe have had robust financial performance, keeping in mind, in spite of the weak \nmacroeconomic situation that is there. We have had higher sports revenue led by ICC Trophy \nas well as IPL. And despite the headwinds, we have kept a very close eye on our costs and \n \n \n \n \n16 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nto ensure that we have profitability and have positive financials for this period. Thank you. \nThat is all from my end. I shall now hand over to Sanjay. \n \n \nSh Sanjay Barman Roy 00:46:03 – 00:52:19 (Oil & Gas) \n \nGood evening, everyone.  \n \nThanks Kevin.  \n \nAlright, just to recap the performance for the year gone by. So this has been by far the \nstrongest year in terms of performance from the oil and gas business. If you look at the year-\non-year consolidated EBITDA, it has been almost 1,000 crore higher than the previous year, \nwhich had at that time set the best performance.  \n \nThe EBITDA margins still remain very healthy at 84% largely driven by higher production, 4% \nproduction from KGD6, as well as stable prices. We did have the benefit of $10.16 a ceiling \nprice in the second half of the year, as well as in CBM, we have completed the first campaign \nof the 40 multilateral wells that has augmented production. We now are seeing a turnaround \nin our CBM business. It had been declining for quite some time, but now progressively the \nproduction keeps increasing with the multilateral wells, which has been an innovation of sorts. \nIt is the first time horizontal multilateral wells have been done in India and successfully \ndeployed in the field. And we are getting significant upside in production.  \n \nWe were looking at about 4,000 standard cubic meters of gas production from the verticals, \nbut we are seeing about 12,000 to 13,000 now. So that is really the benefit we are getting out \nof these multilateral wells. This is a recap of the last quarter, the quarter gone by. \n \nAgain, the quarter was a little bit more muted as compared to the first three quarters only \nbecause production from KGD6. There was a little bit of natural decline on expected lines but \nmore importantly, we had to undertake a lot of maintenance activities towards the end of the \nquarter. \n \nOne of the things is we thought, let us complete these activities, particularly the FPSO had \nto take a planned shutdown for undertaking these maintenance activities, but now all the \nwells are back up on stream and we are back to ramping up the production to about 28 million \nstandard cubic metres. Similarly, CBM, we have commenced the second campaign, so the \nproduction from those will also be seen as we go along.  \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nOverall, if you look at the price realisations in KGD6, it has been slightly better year on year, \nquarter on quarter. And in CBM it has been slightly lower, again driven by the Brent prices \nbut nevertheless, the positive aspect about CBM is that it does not have a price ceiling, so \nyou get market link prices. So how does the global gas market look? I think, largely we have \nseen prices hover in the range of $10-14. There has been a push and pullover there in terms \nof supply and demand on one end, because of potentially weaker economies, we have seen \nthe demand being a little tepid, but at the other end of the anvil you have Europe, where the \ninventory levels are much lower, so the refill is a focus area.  \n \nIndia demand remains robust, I will talk about it in the next slide, but going forward also what \nwe had expected is the LNG glut to come in, as you may be all aware, about 150 million \ntonnes per annum of LNG was expected to be brought online from end 2025 onwards and \nprogressively over the next two to three years. So we expected there might be a strong \npullback in prices, but seeing the delays, again the Biden administration to that extent about \n20 to 30 million tonnes per annum of projects were put on hold.  \n \nAnd the other projects have faced regulatory delays, like in Corpus Christi and some of the \nmajor projects, also in Canada. So we feel that it may not be as exacerbated as we had \nanticipated. The projects may come online, but it should get the gas outlook being what it is. \nThe demand, particularly in the developing nations would be such that it should be absorbed \nwell enough in the next three to four years. So that is really the broad outlook. And so going \nforward, we think we should be on steady ground for gas prices. There will be some amount \nof volatility, but we feel from an Indian market standpoint, it should be all right.  \n \nSo just to give you a recap of the Indian gas market, it looks pretty strong. The demand has \nbeen up by almost 4%, largely driven by city gas distribution and some of the petchem \nexpansions. And again, it is the city gas distribution both in terms of expansion and \npenetration. \n \nSo that is largely contributed out of the eight MMSCMD, nearly four MMSCMD has been \ndriven by CGD. We are also observing a trend that the LNG markets, the long-term contracts \nare being pursued rather than short-term. And so essentially gas for the longer term, the \ndemand looks pretty strong and vibrant in India. The ceiling price also, as you may be all \naware is now being revised to $10.04 cents. And we are contracted for the volume, so we \nare all right there. Thank you and I will invite Srikanth. Thank you. \n \n \nSh V. Srikanth 00:52:31 – 01:14:19 (Oil to Chemicals, New Energy and Summary) \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo starting with the financials, EBITDA lower by 12%. You will see in the slides, but anything \nfrom 36-41% fall in transportation fuel and between 2 and 13% when you look at polymer and \npolyester clearly led by Chinese capacity, slowdown in demand.  \n \nTo a great extent, there was some offsets coming because of the fact that India demand was \ngood, 7.5% for gasoline, ATF was about 9%, both polymer and polyester demand up 5%. We \nplaced a lot through Jio-bp and in the subsequent slide I will talk to you about how impactful \nit was overall.  \n \nWe also benefited from operational excellence. This was the highest throughput that we have \ndone in this refinery. And then, of course, the continuing benefit from cost optimization, \nethane cracking economics worked well. And this is the slide. This tells the full story on \ngasoline, gas oil, and ATF.  \n \nWhen you look at year-on-year change and you look at where it was vis-à-vis five years, \nanywhere between 25-27% lower in the case of gas oil, gasoline, and ATFs about 13%. \n \nThe reasons are known in terms of demand and both China, EU, multiple places, driving \nseason was slow in the US. Similarly when you look at on the downstream petrochemical \nside, naphtha was up 4% but ethane prices were lower by 9% so that benefited us because \nthe deltas were squeezed when you compare it to naphtha, but to the extent we had lighter \nfeed cracking it helped. But the numbers on PE, PPP, PVC, tell you the story of what a 15, \n20 year low means in terms of this environment. So it has been a more difficult one.  \n \nAgain, capacity additions primarily the big driver and then of course demand also being soft. \nSo this is what I was saying in terms of what helped mitigate this otherwise difficult margin \nenvironment, whereas volume growth in Jio-bp you can see 35% higher when you look at \nMS and HSD. ATF up about 62%. Of course, e-mobility is small, but you can see the jump in \npercentages there. And even if you look at our market share now in motor spirits about 3.3, \nin gas oil about 5.2. And importantly, the effectiveness that you see, the market effectiveness \nyou can see the score. Per retail outlet, you can see that the effectiveness of each of these \npumps is very strong. So it is 1.6, it is 2.6 actually in the case of HSD. And this is something \nthat we would continue to expand in the coming year or more. It is 1,916. There is no reason \nwhy it has to be this level. It can be much higher than that. This is the throughput I talked to \nyou about, highest ever at 80.5. \n \nOverall, all the products, so this 2.5% benefit did help mitigate this margin environment. \nOverall, you look at the throughputs were absolutely maximized in platformers and FCC. The \naromatic production that optimization always happens that we continue to do focused on high \n \n \n \n \n19 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \noctane exports, because from the value point of view and continuing benefit from gasification \nhelped the overall performance. And this is just the numbers for the quarter. Again, story not \nvery different in terms of margins being weak, but there were some offsets while fuel was \ndown between 27 and 55% and the whole polyester chain was down. You did see some \noffsets in the form of polypropylene slightly higher by 4%.  \n \nPVC helped at about 13% and then the whole PBR, SBR about 10 to 15%. So also, as I \nmentioned, the whole focus obviously was also on processing the right value of crudes, trying \nto derive advantage from the value adds coming from crude processing, domestic \nplacements continued as a point, some small lift from sulphur prices which really went through \nthe roof and some benefit of exchange rate when you look at it from a rupee earnings point \nof view.  \n \nThis I will not spend too much time. You know the broader environment. Brent did come off \non a year-on-year basis on concerns on tariff, etc. Of course, on a quarter-on-quarter basis \nthe story on ethane was higher because it was up 42% overall versus last year. Having said \nthat, still the cracking economics were pretty favorable and both the refining operating rates \nand the cracker operating rates were fairly stable.  \n \nWhen you look at the demand environment, it rose by about 1.2, geographically if you see, it \nis in Asia, about 0.4, and OECD America is another 0.4. When you look at it from a product \nstandpoint, gasoline was about 0.4 million barrels per day growth, and balance in diesel. \nAgain you can see the stock fall in the delta's $6 cracks versus 13.3.  \n \nAnd China, clear reason with the increasing EV penetration also led to some extent by \ninventory levels were pretty high. The fact that India gasoline demand helped upgrowing 6%. \nSo we continue to focus, as I said, on domestic placement and pushing more volumes here. \nAnd we think near term cracks could find some support.  \n \nGas oil again cracks you can see a significant fall, $14 versus 23.1. Again more led by \ninventories that we saw in Singapore and more exports from the Middle East demand, \nactually if you see it vis-a-vis other products. India demand was up only about 1.1%. Again \nthe actions were broadly similar in terms of focusing on the domestic market and again some \nof the supply disruption kind of concerns can keep the cracks at least stable here.  \n \nAnd ATF fell in line actually you can say with what we saw in gas oil. Demand for ATF has \nbeen good in India and you saw the volume growth in Jio-BP pretty stronger. And we are \nexpecting that these margins stay. \n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nAnd quick ones on each of the individual products with P, this decreased by 10%. Domestic \ndemand has been good. Again, we are trying always to see how much can we maximize light \nfuel cracking here. And the drivers for domestic demand still remains good and we do expect \nthat to stay. \n \nOn PPE, again, delta is slightly up 4%, demand continuing to do well and again, it is a story \nof domestic placement. Actually this whole focus on domestic also plays into the same point \nthat I said. Otherwise if you did not have a domestic exposure like this, I think in this \nenvironment it could have been pretty difficult.  \n \nAnd finally on PVC side that improved because of EDC prices being low and so we saw a lot \nof lift there in terms of year-on-year delta increase. Demand continues to be fairly good in as \nfar as agri and infra is concerned. And do not expect too much of surprises there from a \ndomestic demand point of view.  \n \nAnd finally, on the polyester chain, that is a big chain for us and it was down 15%, mainly due \nto decline in PX prices and the downstream polyester prices, margins did go up but in the \ncontext of what happened in PX, overall the numbers were still lower and we continue to \noptimize PX versus gasoline. And overall again, when you look at polyester demand, if you \nrecall we used to always track this high cotton versus PSF. That differential remains \nattractive, so demand should hold there. \n \nThese are projects that we had talked about, but just putting it there in terms of 1 million tonne \nexpansion for polyester. And the difference is that it is focused on the high growth consumer \nand downstream market. And if you see this specifics on active wear, athleisure, hygiene \ndenim. So these are products which can also command a higher premium. So that's where \nthe focus is and then it is integrated with backward integration with three million tonne PTA \nfacility that is also planned.  \n \nSo in essence, and all these factories will be state of the art and it is got, you know, ensuring \nthat the infrastructure is pretty good from an overall cost effectiveness and efficiency on \ncapex. So projects are there. So we are thinking about this project and of course the next \none on PVC also to see the benefit of all this coming in 2027-2028 in terms of its contribution \nto the EBITDA. And this is the PVC one. This is a more integrated one with caustic chlorine \nand EDC, both in Dahej and then VCM and PVC in Nagothane and then CPVC in Dahej. \n \nAgain, this as you know is a product where India is significantly short even as we talk. It is a \n2 to 2.5 million tonne shortage and we think that possibly it is the right time to be investing \n \n \n \n \n21 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nhere. And these are the basic updates on the vinyl chain and you can see some of the pictures \nthat we have on the visuals on the land that is acquired near Dahej.  \n \nConstruction is commissioned 2026-2027 but financial is coming in 2027-2028. So overall \nthe focus was always on maximizing margin capture, focus on crude procurement, on getting \nmore and more ethane, focusing on the domestic retail sector, as well as industrial sectors. \nWe are trying to do a lot of things on freight cost through term charter vessels because one \naspect is that the deltas are weak, but what can we do differently in terms of ensuring that \nwe are able to negate, if not fully, but yes, you can squeeze out efficiency. So these are things \nthat we are focusing on. \n \nLarger parcels by converting crude tankers to product services focus on recycled PET which \nwe have been talking about and of course both the polyester and the PVC expansion should \ngive us volume lift in 2027-2028 earnings. So, not a very detailed  \n \nupdate, but just to give you some of them in terms of the 10 gigawatt per annum capacity that \nwe have for solar and importantly, it is designed in such a way that it is quick, we can quickly \njump it up to 20 gigawatts, so that is an important point there. We are also focused on 30 \ngigawatts of battery manufacturing. So this is essentially cells to pack, and then you integrate \nit into a BSS system but that is the whole aspect there.  \n \nAgain, when I talk solar, I just want to remind everybody that it is polysilicon to ingot to wafer \nto cell to panel and then of course glass and as well as POE polyolefin elastomer. So when \nwe say it is integrated, we are absolutely integrated from end to end there. So here if you see \nwhere we are, we have commissioned the first gigawatt scale solar module started. So we \nstarted, it is BIS certified already and I would say, the largest from a size point of view at 720 \nwatt peak. It is possibly the largest panel that we have. So that is already commissioned. And \noverall, when you see in each of these, on the entire solar chain, the engineering is complete, \nthe long lead items and procurements are complete and construction is going on in full swing. \nSo I just wanted you to know and this is just one part of what is coming up. And the other one \nis battery also will come in. We have talked a lot about renewable electricity generation, if \nyou were to see. \n \nAnd you know what the access to the land in the Kutch region. \n \nAnd the land, it is arid land and importantly, the solar radiation is pretty good there. So that \ncan fundamentally support almost 150 billion units of electricity. So it is a very large one. And \nas these panels start getting ramped up, the idea is to lift and shift them as and when those \nthat area is ready for it to. So all of them are going on. There again, we have international \n \n \n \n \n22 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nfirms as well as local contractors to obviously level the land and so on so. Work has already \nstarted and dedicated transmission line again from Jamnagar here. So a lot of things are \nhappening essentially in parallel in such a way that this whole thing comes together. In Kandla \nwe have 2,000 acres of land that we have got. And that is where the green hydrogen \necosystem can come in. And before that, electrolyzer, if you recall, with Nel we are in the \nprocess of that electrolyzer manufacturing also, work is going on. So what is unique, I think, \nabout bringing it is there has been no end-to-end like this. We have not seen, at least in our \nmind, we have not seen anybody who is doing end-to-end like this. I mean, when you start \nwith solar and battery and both of them integrate well for renewable energy. So, this kind of \nintegration, and therefore if you were to say hydrogen, where are you going to get the green \nenergy from? That integration is very interesting. And importantly what was plans, we used \nto talk about doing it. \n \nNow with the commencement of solar production and I will show you some pictures, I think I \nhave them, you can see that. And these factories are huge. I mean, it is built on 5,000 acres \nso you can imagine that. I guess at some stage, we will all get the opportunity to go and see \nit. But I am just saying that a lot of work has happened, and the uniqueness comes from \nintegration. The uniqueness comes from the fact that it is scaled. The fact that the factories \nare absolutely state of the art. So what it means for us is if there is cost efficiency, there is \ntechnology efficiency, so when we say what is the cost of producing the final product, there \nis significant confidence that this is way more attractive than what it would be for anybody to \nimport anything into this country. So we are pretty more confident about where those numbers \nare. So it also means that sooner rather than later we may see that the need for us to leverage \non the modular aspect of saying if it is 10 we can take it to 20. So we have now the confidence. \nAnd this is just one aspect of it. Then of course the CBG plans that are there. \n \nJust a quick one on the photographs in terms of where we are. I talked to you about the \ncommissioning of a gigawatt line with the largest module size of 720. I do not know whether \nyou have seen the sizes of other ones, but by far in our minds I think it is the largest, but yes. \nYou can see the commissioning, the electro-luminescence inspection, the packaging which \nis all automated, the edge trimming, the junction box mounting, back support bar placement, \nthe automated guided vehicle. So that you may recall our adverb investment. So these AGVs \nare from them. This is this part of the integration, but it also ties in well with the battery \nmanufacturing facility. So it is a very state-of-art manufacturing shop that we have there. It is \nall on HJT, efficiency is much higher, and people ask about it and you will see that the \nnumbers are pretty good there, so I am happy there. \n \nAnd overall on CBG, we have 10 plants operational we want to scale it up quickly to 55. It \nhas been proved well. Cumulatively it is 200 tonnes per day of production and once you take \n \n \n \n \n23 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nit to 55 it starts becoming meaningful. And overall these are the plants in which it is there. \nAnd we signed recently with MOU with Andhra, so that gives you access to significant amount \nof land and use of specialized grass for creating the CBG. So yes, just to summarize, if you \nsee the context, I think the performance context of the world and context of the environment, \nit is strong. And also we benefited from the fact that India held well, demand was good, and \nof course our assets and our operations have kept us in a very good place. Jio has been the \nstar performer at something like 18% growth. That is pretty impressive. Overall, it is beyond \ndoubt leadership in the network, the number of customers, 5G customers, ARPU. I mean, \nyou see any operational metrics, it has done pretty well. And we have growth drivers from \nmobility. We have it from enterprises, from home. On the retail, we kept flagging that, yes we \nare going through this process of streamlining our operations. We went through the pain of \nthree quarters, but starting last quarter and again this quarter, I think the buoyancy is good \nand we remain very confident about how those numbers will pan out in the coming quarters \nand year. \n \nAnd the brands which we talked about, that I think it is a very good story if you see in what \ntime frames you have achieved the kind of numbers. And I think there is huge value to be \ncreated in that branch. Overall, again on refining and petrochemicals, as I said doing our very \nbest by focusing on all the operational part but I think broadly, slowly, the refining outlook is \ngetting more stable. The additions to refinery capacities are kind of hopefully slowing down. \nAnd our new bouquet of new businesses like media and new energy and AI-ready data \ncenters give you a lot of lift to potentially where are the new sources of earnings. With this, I \nam bringing the presentation to an end. \n \n \nQ&A SESSION 01:14:47 – 01:55:02 \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nFirst, thank you for the presentation. Maybe I will have two questions for Anshuman and one \nfor Kevin. Anshuman like Jio's had a phenomenal 5G ramp-up but why do you think, despite \nthis phenomenal performance in 5G, the market share gains have sort of come off? And also, \nJio led the tariff hike. And despite this quarter's ARPU actually coming ahead of expectation, \nwhy do you think the ARPU is still 15% lower than the number two operator? That is the first \nquestion. \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nLook we have had very good success with our 5G deployment and the proof of the pudding \nis in the data consumption trends, where we continue to expand the gap between us and the \nother operators. The fixed wireless numbers you have seen the TRAI data coming. Why the \n \n \n \n \n24 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \ntariff increase? I think I would urge all of you to look at the way ARPUs are getting computed. \nSo this 15% ARPU gap, when you say, if you just break that up into the reporting basis, so \nlook at the denominator in our case, which is the overall subscriber base, the TRAI reported \nsubscriber base and look at the denominator in the case of the nearest rival, which is not that \nbase, which is a different base. So you are no longer comparing like to like. We come across \ninter-segmental kind of adjustments, and those are massive numbers. So it is really, again, \nonce again not comparable, because you are not looking at what is coming out of mobility \nrevenue versus a whole bunch of enterprise revenues getting intermingled and those \nnumbers could be of the order of 11 to ₹ 1200 crore every month or quarter. So we are not \ncomparing like to like. Our assessment tells us that on the smartphone side, where our tariffs \ntend to be 7-10% lower, we still have ARPUs which are slightly higher. If you do a strict like \nto like comparison. I will let you people do it and give this task to you because normally we \nhave all the tasks and next quarter when we meet we will get into actually doing the numbers, \nbut our assessment is we are slightly higher or a little bit higher, despite the fact that our \ntariffs are lesser. And therefore, the flow-through of impact or any of that, I think we are fairly \nconfident that we are doing quite well. Our customers are using a lot of data. The higher \nARPU, despite our tariff plans being lesser, kind of indicate our customers are picking up the \nhigher plans and their premiums are more. The other bit around why the market shares have \nnot increased, they are increasing. They are increasing when you look at data consumption. \nThey are increasing when you look at actual customer traction on the network. And look \nagain, I will take you back to 2016. Finally, when the network can provide better service, \nbetter quality of service, can carry more load that will translate into more customers coming \nand enjoying superior services, and we do expect that to happen. The fact that we have \ndeployed 5G capacity, which is significantly ahead of the competitors, we believe the capacity \nmarket share will translate into data consumption market share, which is something that is \nalready happening and which will then translate into customer market share and revenue \nmarket share, which also we are seeing already beginning to happen and will only pick up as \nthe time goes by. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nSo you had an excellent acceleration in 5G FWA but that is still under 6 million while fiber \nhomes are 18 and you are reiterating your 100 million home target. Is that banking on 5G \nFWA acceleration? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo that is going to be a combination of what we are doing on AirFiber, which is where we \nhave seen a lot of good success in deployment now. The numbers have been ramping up. \nAnd the fact that we have been able to do that very successfully using both our 5G spectrum \nas well as the UBR radio gives us the confidence that the last mile challenges that we have \nfaced in the past while connecting customers, and we have faced quite a bit of challenges in \nthe last mile, which was kind of expected. It is not only a function of cost, but a function of \ntime really that we will be able to overcome by doing this wirelessly. And which is why we feel \nreasonably confident. Demand is there. Almost half of our FWA connections are coming from \ntier three, tier four cities and rural areas, so demand is fairly wide and prevalent. So if we are \n \n \n \n \n25 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nable to provide the service, we feel reasonably confident demand will be there and more than \n100 million homes definitely need that service today, many more than that. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nSo does the 100 million have a time frame? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nI am not going to give you forward looking, but yes it is. It is a plan. So it is a plan, so it will \nhave a timeframe internally. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nThank you. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nFrom my side first on the balance sheet side, RJIL your spectrum has been significantly \ndeployed now from the accounting perspective while it is not showing up in amortization. Did \nit happen somewhere in between during this quarter? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nWe have capitalized it during this quarter so most of the 5G equipment has been capitalized \ntowards the end of the quarter, so it would show up next quarter. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nAnd the same accounting rule applies, right, as the capacity utilization goes up? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThat is right, somewhat similar. So we are sitting with auditors. We have figured out, given \nthem the plans and on that basis we will be doing, like we did for LTE. So over a period of \ntime, it will get fully amortized. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSecond, this year we did a capex of ₹ 41,000 crore but that will include the creditor payout \nas well? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThat is right. \n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSo what was the underlying capex for this year and how do you see the capex going because \nwe are largely done with the 4G-5G capex, so how should we see the trajectory in the capex \nas a percentage of revenue? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo look most of the capex around the 5G network has been done. We have deployed 5G \nnow pretty much across the country. Coverage is fairly deep. There will still be some infills. \nThere will still be some areas where we will deploy 5G, but that is not going to be very \nsignificant. The network side capex that we needed to do for our fixed wireless as well is done \nmostly, but there will be a little bit of that capex. But we are through the big capex phase for \n5G deployment across the country. Now, really the expansion which is happening when we \nare connecting homes, the network side is done a fair bit, some bit remaining, but other than \nthat, when we are connecting a premise, effectively the customer is paying for the devices. \nSo the capex for Jio at least this phase of capex is mostly done now. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSo what should we look at capex going forward next year? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo I told you, there is not 5G to spend too much money on. We will still have to spend some \nmoney on 5G. And then there is going to be the routine maintenance and a little bit of infill. I \nwill not give you a number, but the bulk of the capex is done. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSo 15-16% is something which is achievable as we know? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nYou will keep trying. I will keep rejecting. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nThanks for hosting this, Anshuman. So firstly, on the non Jio Infocomm revenues, which is \nnow approaching close to $2 billion, growing close to 40% year over year, what are like the \nsubparts of that business that are doing really well for you. And when you think about, let us \nsay within that piece of the business, the $2 billion, how much of that now would be, let us \nsay external customers versus internal group parties? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo on the first part we have a few services which have grown quite well. Cloud has grown \nquite well for us, enterprise cloud, as well as the cloud services, some of the government \ndepartments. Miraj project we have spoken about in the past as well that is scaling up. So \nCloud is something that is doing very well. We have also launched a consumer cloud offering. \nAnd that again, the uptick has been quite good. We are not charging for it today, but there \nwe are seeing good traction. The additional services that we provide to our consumers, both \non mobility and home content for example or some security solutions, those are picking up \nwell once again. And then, enterprise as a part of the overall group is beginning to grow. And \nenterprise is often a combination of two or three services. It is never pure connectivity. We \nare able to bundle in more things. So which again, as the enterprise part of our business \ngrows, you will see more of JPL, digital services revenues also coming in there because that \nis  normally not pure connectivity. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nCan you clarify what is that enterprise services? Like what is included in enterprise services? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nIt could be something else basic as some Cloud facility, the Microsoft Azure stack that we \nprovide to our enterprise customers. It could be security solutions it could be IoT based \nsolutions. So it could be a combination of things that we take to enterprises beyond just \nconnectivity. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nAnd just last question on this one, I mean, growth momentum obviously is like two times of \nyour connectivity business here? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThat is right. It is of a smaller base. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nBut from a growth perspective, this should continue to be a meaningfully faster growing piece \nthan the connectivity piece is that safe to assume? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nIt should, the market opportunity is there. We are very focused on it. And it is coming off a \nsmaller base, so percentage growth will look good. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo I have got three questions on the energy side. First is, in terms of your O2C performance \nhow much could have been contributed by Jio-bp alone during this quarter? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \n₹ 2,500 crore was the EBITDA for the year. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nFor the year for Jio-bp as a whole? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nYes. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nRight Sir and second question is on your polyester expansion that you have mentioned. So \nthis is a new announcement, right? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nWe said ₹ 75,000 crore we will spend when AGM speech this covered O2C projects, so this \nis part of it. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nFY2027 is the commissioning of the plant or commissioning of the project? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nNo, I said 2027-2028 you will see the benefit of the expansion in terms of earnings, etc. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nRight and it will be a full impact itself or there could be ramp-up then also? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nIt is too early to say that, but yes, we are determined to obviously get it done and try and see \nwhether it is a full year impact, but we will see. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n4 \nAnd last question is on new energy. You mentioned that the solar factory is like 10 gigawatt. \nSo you have commissioned a gigawatt line. So that is like close to 10 gigawatt? \n \n \n \n \n29 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nNo, no it is a part of the line. When you say gigawatt, it is 1 gigawatt or 1.2, that kind that is \nhow it comes. You roll out your production in phases like that. I mean, you do not start a full \n10 gigawatt line. So you will do it as 1 or 1.25. That is the way you scale it in. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nAnd you will be using the modules internally to build generation capacity in Kutch? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nThat is correct. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nYou have already acquired land there, and you are setting up transmission towers right now? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nYes absolutely. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nAnd solar generation is expected by what time? Solar power generation? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nSo if you think about overall generation wise again, it is fair to say 2027-2028, that is the kind \nof time frame by which anything meaningful will happen. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nAnd then it will be used captively? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nYes correct. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nThank you so much. \n \nProbal Sen \n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nHi Sir good evening Prabal here. Just a couple of questions again on oil and gas. Coming \nback to the Jio-bp mobility. The presentation mentioned about 1,900 outlets already \noperational so given the performance and the trends that we see in retail margins as of now \nare there any plans to aggressively expand that network to grab market share? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nThat is right, yes we have. Not mentioning the numbers, but obviously this kind of \nperformance also means that it makes sense for us to invest and we will expand that network. \n \nProbal Sen \n \nRight and the second question was on the upstream part of it, where you mentioned that \nthere is some decline that has been seen in terms of production. Obviously these are all \nmarginal fields that you have developed. So what kind of trend can we expect for the next \ncouple of years? And the second part I had was that is it at a stage where the government \nshare of profit petroleum is now slightly higher, and that also impacts the earnings for that \npart of the business? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nSanjay your area, you want to talk. He is trying very hard to arrest this pace of decline. \n \nSh Sanjay Barman Roy \n \nSo the fact is there is going to be a natural decline. Now, two things that we have observed \nis the performance is slightly better than expectations and we have also identified some \nupsides and we are working on those upsides and we are looking at doing some work over \njobs also to augment the production sometime next year. Also, we have identified a few \nadditional wells in the fields where we feel the reservoirs are not getting depleted. So those \nare things that we are trying to bring on stream. So yes, there will be a natural decline, but \nwe are trying to offset that and augment it with some of the activities that we expect to start \nfrom the middle of next year. What was the second part of the question? \n \nProbal Sen \n \nI was saying that the government share of profit petroleum has the investment multiple \nreached a stage where their share starts to really go up substantially over the next couple of \nyears? \n \nSh Sanjay Barman Roy \n \nNot as yet. I mean, it is still in a good place. So again, it all depends on the price realizations. \nObviously, we believe the production is good. But it is natural to expect when you are getting \nmore value, the share of profit petroleum may shift. But again, as of now, we do not see that \nshifting in the immediate term. \n \n \n \n \n31 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nProbal Sen \n \nOne last question, if I may, again on the expansion projects in the downstream that you \nmentioned. It is obviously part of the ₹ 75,000 crore. Is it possible to share the capex for the \nspecific expansions on PX and PTA, roughly? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nNot now, but yes, it is well below ₹ 75,000. Overall, maybe in the ₹ 60 to 65,000. But still, we \nare just putting that together. \n \nProbal Sen \n \nThank you very much. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nA question for Anshuman. Anshuman any thoughts on telecom tariff hot topic you had like \nonce in two years, once in one-and-a-half years now. Is it possible like to share and would \nyou say annual tariff hike is a possibility now? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nNo that is too speculative to talk about really. No guidance. Look, we will have to continue to \nsee how the market grows. For us, priorities are market growth. Priority is at this point in time \nmore 5G user base and traction. So that is not a thought currently crossing our minds for \nsure. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nOkay and another hot topic, any comment on IPO? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nWhat comment? Someday we will come and tell you now we are going to launch an IPO \nprocess. Before that, there is no comment. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nLike one on retail, so quick commerce any plans for 10 minute delivery, dark stores? How \nare you thinking about that? And are you seeing any impact of quick commerce in the metro \ncities? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo Dinesh spoke about that, but maybe you can summarize it again. \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja \n \nSee, two parts to it. We are looking at a sub 30 minute delivery right? So we are using our \nstore network, delivering within a three kilometer radius. So most of our areas, most of the \npin codes get covered. We have 4,000 pin codes where we are able to cover within that. \nThere are some dark pockets where we will set up dark stores also, wherever there is a \ngenuine requirement, there is enough volume and we cannot service it within 30 minutes, we \nmay set up some dark stores as well. So that is on the quick commerce side of it. Our stores, \npurely on a standalone basis, are seeing double digits like for like growths for last several \nquarters. So stores are also growing pretty rapidly. We are not seeing that impact either in \nmetro or in any other city. \n \nEven metro cities, our stores continue to grow in a pretty healthy manner. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nAnd lastly, if you can, let us say, talk about like overall capex for the company as a whole? \nShould we see a decline or how should we look at FY2026 capex? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nWe have been holding the capex pretty well, I thought. At least the big parts of somebody \nwas asking on Jio. I mean, it is pretty obvious now that that part of the capex growth, the big \nones have happened and now on it is going to be much smaller, some percentage of revenue \nyou were asking of it. I would like to believe it will go down, obviously. The other capexes on \nO2C which we talked about or known capexes which are part of the plan. New energy is also \ngive or take, we talked about ₹ 75,000 crores for setting up of the whole giga factory and \nbetween a combination of what we have spent and we have already committed, I think fair to \nsay that the entire ₹ 75,000 we are already in. The bigger ones will start coming in when you \nstart generating electricity, because then you are really taking the panels and generating. But \nthat is going into later further down. So overall capex looks in that sense within these \nboundaries that I talked to you about. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nOkay thank you for the opportunity for questions. We are just starting with the new energy \npart of the business. Can we talk about the next set of the timelines? When do we expect to \nhit 10 gigawatt module cell, polysilicon, and also where are we on the battery manufacturing? \nWe talked about the 30 gigawatt module, cell, polysilicon, and also where are we on the \nbattery manufacturing? We talked about the 30 gigawatt hour battery manufacturing capacity. \nWhere are we and what is the more realistic timeline we should think about for the ramp-up? \nAnd if you can also talk a little bit about the battery technology we are pursuing here. \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \n \n \n \n33 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nI am going to ask Kiran to answer this. I have all my colleagues from refining and pet chem, \nso very happy for Srinivas or Sridhar to answer some of these questions but specifically, \nKiran, why do not you take the floor? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nFirst question was on the timelines on the solar manufacturing, right? As Srikanth sir \nmentioned, we are very well progressing. The entire engineering has been done for the entire \nvalue chain, whether it is polysilicon, cell module, glass and POE. The equipment orders \nhave been placed and the construction is going on. I think we have defined that by end of \n2025, early 2026, all these factories will get commissioned and will start producing and we \nare well on our way to achieve that. The second question was on battery technology. It is \nlithium ion phosphate. It is a large format prismatic cells, which is for storage requirements, \nutility scale storage requirements. Again, very well progressing on that, the construction has \nalready started. So in 2026, you will start seeing, starting with packs and then going to the \ncells, the manufacturing. Again, it is a full entire value chain, including battery materials that \nwe are doing. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nThanks Kiran can you clarify, so the first batch will be the packing of the cells and then the \ncell assembly will happen roughly by what timeline? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nSo everything is progressing together. So it is just probably a matter of a quarter to two \nquarters. By the time you will start seeing container, pack, and then cell in that sequence, \neffectively. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nGreat. So that was in the new energy. If I can also ask a question on refining. So just more \nin terms of the environment of the crude discounting and the crude environment over the past \nyear versus what we expect in FY2026, the reason I am asking is, of course, we had an \nenvironment of high Russian crude discounts in the past couple of years, which appears to \nbe narrowing but at the same time, OPEC is releasing more barrels in the market. So net-\nnet, the crude discounting environment, do we expect to improve in FY2026 versus 2025 or \nrather stay flat or a little more tougher? Thank you. \n \nSh Sreedhar Rudraraju \n \nSee, when compared to two years back, we have seen correction to crude discounts. Crude \npremiums have gone up because as more and more new markets got diversified, so that \nsituation got corrected to a large extent. Being a complex refiner, we continue to enjoy decent \ncrude discounts when compared to the peer group. In general, AG premiums have slightly \n \n \n \n \n34 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \ncorrected with the ongoing easing out in terms of crude production because non-OPEC crude \nproduction is coming up in a significant way. If you see, we are seeing significant growth in \nnon-OPEC production from last year to this year. So that will put pressure on the AG crude \npremiums going down, which will help the Asian refiners. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nIf I may, just last question. On chemical, we earlier talked about increasing our ethane \nsourcing mix. Where are we in terms of our feedstock mix right now, ethane, propane, and \nnaphtha and how does that mix change, and the timeline of implementing of the ethane mix \nand how does that change in the next one or two years? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nSo ethane mix is actually linked to our expansion projects on vinyls. We have already ordered \nthree new ships with the shipyards and they are likely to start getting delivered sometime in \n2026 second half. That is the timeline and then they are phased out over a period of time. \nAnd as I said, they are primarily meant that extra ethane is meant for the expansion project \nof the vinyls. Does that answer your question? \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nOn this PVC thing that we are putting up the project, this was actually supposed to be put in \nADNOC, right? That has been changed now to Dahej? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nYes. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nThat is the same one, right? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nIt is the same one. We shifted the whole project within India itself. So this will be at $2 dollar, \nthe sum remains same. We have added a couple of things we have added a CPVC element \nalso into it. We have added a RelWood element also into it, so it is become a wider project \nthan what it was. Of course the cost numbers also change because the cost factors in Abu \nDhabi were very different from what they are in India and the size of project has also actually \ngone up. So we were talking about a million tonnes of PVC there, we are now talking more \nthan 1.25. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nAnd how do we plan to consume the caustic because we will consume chlorine, we will sink \nchlorine in PVC. We will be ending up having 1.5, 1.6 million? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nSo that is the advantage we have because this particular industry has a challenge of \nconsuming actually the chlorine. But we will be advantaged in that position that we will have \nchlorine consumption. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nYou can take entire industry into a disadvantage position because we will be having 25% of \nIndia's caustic production at one location. \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nI mean I agree with you, there will be caustic surplus in the country and for a while for initial \nperiod of one or two years we will export some of that caustic and manage the situation. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nOne on battery, this LFP battery, we will be doing it all ourselves as in LFP production to \nbattery production, everything we will be doing? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAs I said it will be fully integrated from battery materials such as cathode, anode, electrolyte \nall the way to cell battery. And we will not be doing lithium carbonate production because that \neffectively goes into the mining. India does not have that rich resources. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nAnd we have a supply arrangement for the carbonates. \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nIt is a surplus market. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nTwo questions on telcos, one on the retail. On telco Anshuman clearly the tariff hikes we \nhave taken for Jio it is more back-end loaded as compared to other telcos. So should we \ncontinue to see benefit of tariff hikes in coming quarters or most of it is largely behind us? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nA little bit more because some of our annual plans are still quite popular and those impact \nwill flow through almost. The hike happened in early July so when the next recharge happens, \nthere will still be some impact of that. And we had also allowed customers to do stacking, \nthough people do not stack annual plans that much they do not do but some impact may still \nbe there. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nAnd commensurate margin improvement should be seen, right as in how RPU improves? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nYes, they should but look there are lots of combination of things which impact the margins \nthere. But this revenue increase should improve the margins. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nSecond question, telco vendor payables, how much is roughly the number right now? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThe vendor payables? Capex creditors now? \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nYes capex creditors. \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSort of we have other numbers. We have mostly taken credit now. It is all converted into \nloans. So we do not have much of that now. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nThank you. On retail, the question is, is the turnaround largely done? Because there were \nthree parts from what I understand. The B2C rationalization, which as we saw today, you \nguys are adding stores. Second was on the B2B side, and third one was fashion being slow. \nSo where are we in terms of B2B rationalization and fashion uptake. \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja \n \nSee, it is pretty much done. So if you look at on the store side, we continue to add new stores \nwhile we weeded out all the stores which did not make sense, right? So we opened 2700 \nnew stores, we closed almost 2200. My net addition is only 500. B2B also we have kind of \nweaned down some of the low margin categories which were not making sense. So, that is \nsomething that transition has also been completed that is already reflecting in the numbers. \n \n \n \n \n37 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo, if you look at our margins, margins are expanding because of both of these. Now when \nyou look at the fashion, yes, the market has still been weak. If you look at most of our \ncompetition, the market is still weak. But for us Q3 was a good quarter even Q4. With all the \nwork that we have been doing on, reducing the design to shelf cycle, reducing inventory, \nincreasing the design quotient, making design more AI enabled. All of that is starting to bear \nfruit now. We have had positive LFL growths and double digit growth in the fashion business \nin this year. We believe it has turned the leaf and we will see this continuous growth quarter \nand quarter going forward. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nGot it. And when should we start seeing any meaningful contribution from Shein? \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja \n \nWe have just launched it. We just did a beta launch in February. It is important to get a certain \nnumber of options on the platform. This year is when we look at meaningful scale-up. We will \nalso start advertising. You need to have a certain basic minimum number of options to offer \na customer the choice before you start advertising too much. The good thing is just when we \ndid organic, just on their own we saw significant downloads. It was one of the top ten \ndownloaded apps during those initial few days when we did the beta launch. I think as we \nmarketed and as we add more options, we should see the pickup in this year. \n \nJal Irani \n \nIf you do mind can I have the privilege of the last few questions. I have a series of questions \nactually on the new energy business, if I may ask them one by one. You all are obviously \nstarting module production way ahead of your own in-house consumption i.e., for power \nrequirements. Now, modules, as you know, are perishable commodities. Are you all looking \nto sell this in the market initially, especially as the DCI market is extremely lucrative? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nI think what Srikanth mentioned with respect to the generation capacity coming later or \ngeneration coming later it is about the significant capacity coming later. But as our modules \nget manufactured and as we have got the land in Kutch which is already in development \nstage, we will start getting the modules installed in Kutch itself. Having said that, the beauty \nof an integrated business model is it provides the business flexibility. As the markets give \nopportunities, whether it is Indian or International, we will benefit from those opportunities. \n \nJal Irani \n \nSir, if I may pursue further on that and I understand that basically your EPC has to start six \nmonths prior to actually the module production. And I am not aware of actually any EPC \nworks started materially as yet. So your module production is started, but it is still going to \n \n \n \n \n38 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \ntake at least six months to get consumed on site. So you will still have a module surplus \nstraight away, right? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nLet me just say EPC is engineering, procurement and construction, right? So we already \nstarted at least two legs and the C leg is also working or progressing. \n \nJal Irani \n \nAnd HJT is clearly the next generation technology, the Chinese as well are going slow on it. \nHow are the sort of initial efficiencies? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nIt is pretty good. \n \nJal Irani \n \nThe Chairman’s actually targeted 26% to start with and going to 28%. Is that in line? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nThe cell efficiency you are talking about? \n \nJal Irani \n \nYes, the cell efficiency. \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAbsolutely in line and we are seeing those benefits. \n \nJal Irani \n \nOkay and on electrolyzers, what sort of tie-up do you have with Nel and what is the \ntechnology? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nI think we have already announced that. There is a press release on Nel when we did the tie-\nup. Nel is actually one of the oldest electrolyzer manufacturing companies out of Europe. \nThey are very good in alkaline technology and that is what we think is going to be beneficial \nfor utility scale. We have a tie-up to set up the manufacturing as well as do technological \ncollaboration with Nel. \n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nJal Irani \n \nIn terms of economics, I mean the Chinese I believe, have reached economics of $350 \nkilowatt hour, right? And Nel is I thought more like 1000? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nI would not be able to give you the number, but I think in partnership with us, we will get to \nthe economics which makes us cost competitive. \n \nJal Irani \n \nAnd finally on hydrogen, how far is that out 2028 perhaps? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAgain I won't be able to give you the timeline on hydrogen, but we are very well prepared to \nserve the market. \n \nJal Irani \n \nBecause you have also won several PLIs, right? And they have got an expiry date. So, how \nwould you manage that? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nWe will deliver to the PLIs. \n \nJal Irani \n \nWithin three years, I think production is going to start. \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nWe will deliver. It is not much that volume is not significant, right, if you look at it from overall \nperspective. \n \nJal Irani \n \nAnd on target to reach a $1 cost? The last question, on target to reach $1 cost by 2030? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAgain I would not be able to give you an indication on the direction on that. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \n \n \n \n40 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nI understand that the mergers only happened in mid-November, but can you give a sense on \nthe growth that you are seeing because television advertising is struggling. It is still below \npre-COVID levels. And also your margins are only 3%. How quickly with whatever growth \nambition you have, do you see that catching up with peers who are at multiple of that? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nActually, at the moment, we are in the midst of growing our viewership, growing our platform. \nI always believe, I am saying is, if you can grow those two parameters, revenues will always \nfollow right? So we are quite optimistic looking at the start where we had whether it is with \nthe app or if you look at where our channels are performing on today's date in most in most \nmarkets we are leaders. We have got eight to ten of the top 10 programmes, and I think if we \ncan manage viewership revenue will always follow. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nYes but there seems to be something very structural about television advertising, because \ndespite 100 million pay TV homes and it growing, it is still below pre-COVID level in 3-4 years. \nWhile digital advertising has doubled? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nI do not know which source you're looking at. But if you look at the EY reports, etc., television \nis all way above the pre-COVID. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nBut is it growing? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nIt is. If you look at any of the reports that have come up, and the predictions for the future, it \nis showing a positive prediction. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nTelevision will also grow? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nYes very much. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nAnd your margin catch up, do you think the 3% margin will go to double digits is it possible, \ndigital and sports so do you have a margin ambition or a target? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nWe have margin ambition. We have EBITDA ambition. And this is pretty big what we have in \nmind is absolutely. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nCan I just ask for Anshuman one question? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nThis is possibly the last question. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nYou spoke about 5G monetization. So could you just throw some more light on that? What \nare your thoughts on that? Basically, how can we look at ARPU improvement, in the absence \nof tariff hikes? Obviously, 5G monetization should be key, 40% of subscribers now on 5G. \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nYes 45% of the data consumption, data traffic on 5G. And opportunity to give more services, \nso a combination of things like network slicing, being able to offer some differentiated superior \nservices, enterprise offerings so we see many opportunities there. The network has stabilized \nquite well, so we are confident that we will be able to demonstrate or provide those services \nand then be able to charge a premium for some of those services. So those efforts are going \nto be taken over the next few months, few quarters. Again, the reason I spoke about the \nKumbh case study was also because in very difficult circumstances, we were able to offer \nfairly differentiated services. Now, we expect customers to be willing to pay for some of those \nservices, enterprises definitely and we are differentiated, so no other operator will be able to \noffer those kinds of differentiated services. So both additional revenues, incremental ARPUs, \nas well as just getting more customers, because customers will look for those kind of services. \nWe see those opportunities in the next few quarters for us. \n \nDevanshu Bansal \n \nSo question on the retail business. Of the 2,200 stores which was streamlined, if you can just \ngive some picture in terms of between consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle and \ngrocery, where the biggest part of streamlining happened. And also on the fashion and \nlifestyle, you touched upon, reducing the timeline from design to shelf and reducing the \ninventory or increasing inventory returns. So given the Shein partnership, is it also coming \nfrom their global learning or maybe is it because of the Shein partnership was done internally? \n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo I will answer the second one first and wait for Dinesh to turn up for the first one. It is a \nwhole bunch of projects we have undertaken over the last three or four quarters, over the last \nyear. We have had a big technical project to cut down on the time from design to shelf. And \nthat has been done pretty much by ourselves, based on our own experiences across running \nthis business for the last almost 17 to 18 years, the learnings that we have got. Shein is a \ndifferent business. That partnership is focused on Shein itself. And at this point in time, yes, \nthe effort has been to create the domestic supply chain, which we have been able to now roll \nout quite well. We have over 12,000 options on Shein now and we have been able to create \nthe domestic supply chain to be able to give that, provide a similar service as Shein offers \nglobally. But these are two separate instances. The whole tech platforms are separate. \n \nSh Gaurav Jain \n \nSo I think the question was on the store optimization. So I think it has been across the formats. \nWe have seen store closures but it is also because of a variety of reasons. It could be just \nabout some stores maybe have shifted because of maybe the trade areas or the consumer \npreferences moving. Some stores not performing well because maybe the mall itself is not \nperforming up to the mark and so it is a function of variety of reasons for both fashion largely \nand also for grocery business so it is both from small town to largely mall based stores and \nin large cities. So we have seen maybe just optimization in large pockets. But we have also \nreplaced all of those stores with new stores, so you actually see for the year, there is a net \naddition of about 500 stores. \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nTruly the last question, and thank you so much. We are absolutely delighted that we got this \nopportunity to present and have this interaction and look forward to the next one three months \nfrom now. Thank you.", "status": "success"},

Srikanth 00:00:01 – 00:06:36 (Macro Environment and Performance) \n \nBut before that, just the overall macroeconomic. So, this is all about the context being \nsignificant volatility, tariff-related. We saw geopolitical conflicts continuing. You all know there \nwere significant pressures on the margins overall on the back of both China capacity, weak \ndemand. I think the clear standout is when you look at the overall numbers, the fact that ours \nhas been a more domestic focus, if I start with each of the businesses, obviously with O2C, \nwe saw strong demand growth. You have seen it in gas, oil, you have seen it in gasoline. You \nhave seen it in ATF. You have also seen it in polymer, polyester. Oil and gas demand has \nbeen good. Retail has been actually in some ways mixed. First half was slow.  \n \nAlso, if you recall, we had three full quarters of significant streamlining and rationalization that \nwe did, and beginning last quarter and more importantly this quarter you can see the pick-up \nin EBITDA. And second half also benefited from Mahakumbh and festive demand.  \n \nJio is in a very strong performance - customer additions, 5G subscribers, the ARPU going up \nand we did not lose customers, or we did not lose the intensity of data consumption too. The \nfull year if you look at it, when I say energy here, I have taken O2C and upstream as part of \nthe 8% number.  \n \nWe saw that, weaker cracks, polyester, to a great extent negated by a lot of things that we \ndid on feedstock optimization. Domestic push has been a big standout, and I have a few \nslides on A, our market share, and B, what has been the growth in volumes there. Overall, I \nthink the other point I would definitely flag is when you look at the O2C or energy performance \nin the context of how other global refineries have performed or standalone petrochemical \nmanufacturers or even actually integrated players. If you see the numbers, it is absolutely \nstandout in terms of our performance. So that is how EBITDA was lower by 8%.  \n \nJio platforms up 17% on the back of, of course, the leadership in technology, the number of \ncustomers added the ARPU increase, and now we are the world's largest data company and \nhave 191 million 5G subscribers and ARPU at ₹ 206 plus at 13.5%. \n \nOn retail I talked to you about the first half being soft and all the efforts on streamlining and \nrationalizations of stores, etc., and the third and fourth quarter has been pretty good. And \n \n \n \n \n3 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nalso, all the operating metrics in terms of transactions, in terms of number of customers, all \nof them holding pretty well. And a lot of focus on quick commerce and Dinesh will talk to you \nabout what we are doing on quick commerce.  \n \nAnd of course, on JioStar, the effective date was somewhere in November. It is the largest \nmedia and entertainment company in India. Again, I do not want to steal the thunder of Kevin, \nbut 280 million subscribers and I think I just like the statistics on 61 million live concurrency. \nI think it means a lot in the context of what you have seen even globally. And Kevin do talk \nabout this when he presents. So these are the overall numbers on a full year basis, revenue \nup 7%, but obviously muted on EBITDA and PAT and we talked about O2C's performance \nthere.  \n \nWhen you look at each of, obviously the consumer business fully offset the weakness there. \nWhen you look at the PAT numbers for each of the entities, you can see JPL at ₹ 26,000 \ncrore, it is up 22% and RRVL almost ₹ 12,400 crore, up 11%. RIL stand-alone impacted \nbecause of O2C. \n \nHere is the balance sheet. So it has been a flat net debt environment and look at the capex \nversus our cash profits. Clearly, we continue to be below and all the numbers are pretty \nhealthy there and allows us to invest. For the quarter revenues were up about 9% and \nEBITDA 4% up and again, PAT 6.4. Broad story on margins and when we talk about OTC, \nwe will see that there has been this broader compression on deltas across transportation, \nfuel, and polymer and also maybe not on the polymer side, definitely has been weak. And big \noffsets with Jio on with up 18% and retail up 14%. Oil and gas was impacted with lower \nproduction. \n \nWith this Anshuman. \n \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur 00:06:44 – 00:21:15 (Jio Platforms) \n \nThanks Srikanth. \n \nGood evening everyone. \n \nWelcome to the physical analyst meet. An update on the performance of Jio platforms. Strong \nrevenue and EBITDA growth. This was a combination of both the tariff impact flowing through \nbut in addition a lot of success that we are seeing with our home rollout, home broadband \nrollout, both combination of fiber, but more importantly fixed wireless and I'll speak a bit more \n \n \n \n \n4 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nabout that. Consolidated operating revenues for the full year at ₹ 1,28,218 crore and EBITDA \nat ₹ 64,170, so roughly around 17 to 18% growth. For the quarter, the consolidated revenue \nwas very close to ₹ 34,000 crore. The total subscriber base at 488.2 million, so that is a net \naddition of 6.1 million for the quarter. So the little bit of impact that we saw a couple of quarters \nago when tariffs were raised, well and truly back, is behind us and we are now adding \nsubscribers. We are seeing good traction on the ground and also seeing very good \nconsumption trends on the ground.  \n \nARPUs at ₹ 206.2 so a little bit of flow through of the tariff increase and also some bit of more \ndata consumption in this quarter. Data traffic on the network grew 20% year on year to 49 \nexabytes in this quarter. So we continue to break all records for data consumption and this is \nnot only Indian records but global records. The growing 5G subscriber mix as well as the \nhome connects all adding to the data traffic growth. \n \nAlso, we are seeing good traction with digital revenues as well, digital service revenues on \nthe back of Cloud services which are now launched for enterprises. We have won some good \ncompetitive tenders for government clients and then a bunch of services around IoT that we \nprovide and also the content bundling that we do for services provided to our home \ncustomers. So a whole lot of initiatives leading to this strong financial and operating \nperformance and I will speak through some of those. \n \nMobility, our lead, our success in the 5G deployment and now 5G consumption and \ncustomers' uptake of 5G is very clearly visible on the ground. This map from Ookla shows \nagain we have pretty much pan India 5G coverage now. We cover most of our customers \nand we have been able to transition 191 million users to 5G, which is the largest base outside \nof China, and if you recollect the last quarter itself we had spoken about how we are now the \nworld's largest data company in terms of overall data consumption and we continue to be \nthat, ahead of companies from China as well, bigger than China Mobile. 5G traffic as a \npercentage of total traffic has been growing, so we are now at 45% of total wireless traffic is \non 5G, and this continues to grow and data consumption is continuing to grow, and we are \nseeing the per capita consumption for consumers when on 5G network is significantly higher. \n \nSo people are finding the usage to use more data, and we believe that is sticky kind of usage \nand that will give us the ability to monetize that more as we go forward. We have really not \nstarted monetizing 5G. So effectively, 45% of data that people today are consuming is being \noffered to them free of cost. They become eligible to use that data, but after that they are not \nreally paying for it, but they are getting into the habit of consuming content, consuming data, \nbut they are not paying for it but they are getting into the habit of consuming content, \nconsuming data, consuming 5G services, and we believe that is a very big opportunity for us \n \n \n \n \n5 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nin the same way that LTE was a big opportunity for us in 2016. The fact that that differentiated \nLTE data capacity creation that we had done, which subsequently led to the revenue market \nshare, finally it has to reflect at some point in time. We are seeing a similar trend now \nbeginning to emerge here. And we see this as a massive opportunity as far as wireless \nservices are concerned, and even home broadband services are concerned. And at these \nscales, where 191 million users, 45% of data traffic on the network, we are able to give 224 \nmbps 5G download experience. The overall download experience across all the tests that we \ndo and then external agencies do, they have all been very positive. The customer user \nexperience has been extremely positive on the 5G network. Despite the growth in traffic, we \nhave been holding up quite well. \n \nA case study, an example of that was the Mahakumbh, which I am sure all of you are familiar \nwith. This was over 660 million devotees gathering within 40 square kilometers in 45 days. \nAnd the way our network held up, and we did put in a lot of effort to make sure that the \nnetwork held up during those 45 days in the Mahakumbh. It was the densest data \nconsumption, population conversion that anybody had ever seen globally. We were working \nwith our vendors, with our partners, and they were tracking the data usage as well, and it was \nmind-boggling for all of them. Nobody anywhere in the globe had ever seen something like \nthis. There were limited access zones, there were jammers put all across, but we still had to \nmake sure that people were able to consume as much data that they wanted and they were \nonline all the time. A big difference we saw here, the uplink traffic used to be quite high. So \na lot of people were uploading videos and pictures and normally that is not the way you plan \nyour network. You would expect downlink to be much more. And we had to therefore adjust \nsome of this there on the ground, on the site. We were able to, with our spectrum that we \nhave, but the government had given us some spectrum during that period to just provide \nservices to the customers, we were able to test the elasticity of that network, really, in that \nsmall period or small space where we saw 2.2 million GB of data traffic, bulk of the usage of \n5G, so the whole area was enabled with 5G. We were giving download and upload speeds \nof 200 mbps plus, 141 million voice minutes. So this has kind of become a case study for \nnetwork companies, telecom companies, service providers, vendors, everybody is looking at \nthis as a case study where these kind of global records were set in a short period of time. \nAnd we learned a lot. \n \nTo now sweat the assets on our network much more, the deployment that we have already \ndone, plus with the spectrum that we have got, the network is fairly elastic. We can keep \nadding more customers with tweaks to the network, being able to track where the data \nconsumption, or where the consumption is, where the users are. The elasticity of this network \nis fairly high. That gives us confidence that with the network that we have already created, \nwe can serve hundreds of millions more customers on this network. We feel reasonably \n \n \n \n \n6 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nconfident about that. The fixed wireless stack, now this is something that we have been \ndeploying extensively on the ground, as you are aware about this. The recent TIA report said \nthat we have 85% market share in this. \n \nIn this particular product which has gone live in the market over the last few months, we have \nbeen deploying a fair bit of fixed wireless, both on our 5G spectrum but also on the UBR. We \nhave developed or now deployed, not only developed, so it is in commercial use, the first \npoint-to-point wireless solution for fixed wireless. So this is not point-to-point. In the way the \nnetwork is configured, we can use single radiating equipment to serve multiple customers. \nWe have been able to, through that, reduce the cost of deployment. So the cost that we incur \nto connect every new home is incrementally much lesser than what you would hear about \ncompanies elsewhere which are doing such a thing. The spectral efficiency is higher. And we \nhave been able to create the full mapping of the country where our customers are. This is a \nvery important functionality. So when we get a customer inquiry or a customer request to \nconnect a customer, we know exactly which way, which technology to use, which site to \nradiate from for a particular customer. If the fiber is available, of course we connect the \ncustomer with fiber, but otherwise with our 5G spectrum, in some cases UBR, we know \nexactly, it is pretty 3 meter x 3 meter map, where we know exactly what kind of throughput \ndifferent technologies will provide to customers. And that is very powerful on the ground when \nthe implementation is going on, when the network engineers have to be on the ground \nconnecting new homes and new premises. And all of this is being done completely end to \nend value chain is in our control, be it the devices, the technology, deployment, all of that has \nbeen done in-house. So we are not taking this technology or taking any equipment. Now, \npretty much all the equipment is being manufactured, produced by ourselves within the \necosystem. They have been designed ourselves and they have been produced in India, all \nof this is made in India, and being done completely within the Jio ecosystem. As a result of \nwhich, we are feeling confident to be able to connect 100 million homes, which is a target \nthat we have set for ourselves. \n \nIn the last six months, we have had 90% of industry net ads, 5x higher than the next nearest \ncompetitor. So the chart on the right top that you see is the number of AirFiber subscribers, \nbasically the fixed wireless subscribers. We call it AirFiber because unlike traditional definition \nof fixed wireless, in our case, we are giving completely synchronous uplink, downlink, and \nthroughputs because of the way the network is configured, because of the spectrum that we \nare using. So when we say 1 Gbps at home for home broadband using either our 5G \nspectrum or the UBR, that is uplink and downlink of 1 Gbps. That is what we have enabled, \nwhich is reflecting in the ramp-up of AirFiber subscribers. In the recent months, we have also \ntransitioned from the 5G spectrum to UBR. \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nUBR is now commercially live, even in situations where we do not have direct line of sight \nwhich has been a bug challenge just about every operator globally. We are able to do without \nnano site connections as well by reflecting the radio from other surfaces. This is unique. This \nis proprietary and we have been doing this successfully and commercially, so it is all \ncommercially deployed on the ground. The chart at the bottom is not supposed to be pacman, \nbut we have good lead over the others in the industry. \n \nThis is the other deployment which is now being done successfully, commercially on the \nground, which is our private 5G instances for enterprise customers. As you can see, the \nnetwork is the same, but we are able to create a dedicated slice for use cases for enterprises, \nfor whatever the end use case may be, including for fixed wireless. We have a network slice \nthat we use to provide that service. And then create a secure tunnel on our own private 5G \ncore. As you know, we have spoken about this in the past that our 5G core, the whole network \ncore, 4G and 5G core is completely deployed by us. It is our own proprietary core. And we \nare able to create private instance of that for our enterprise customers. And this has got many \nuse cases. We already have deployed in some of the industrial situations, industrial premises, \nincluding in Jamnagar, and use cases around robotic automation, video surveillance, \nenhanced security. \n \nWe are able to give ultra-reliable, low latency network. We are able to do network slicing to \nensure consistent service delivery irrespective of the amount of load that the network may \nhave at any point in time, and able to provide end-to-end managed services. With those few \nupdates around stuff that we are doing on technology and the progress we have made over \nthe last few months, especially on 5G and the home and home deployment, coming to the \nkey operating matrices for the business, the subscriber base, as I said, has grown to 488.2 \nmillion, so that was a net addition of 6.1 million during the quarter. ARPU went up to 206.2, \nand remember this is a shortened quarter, so in that sense the growth is a little bit more than \nthat in percentage terms. The average data consumption continues to grow, 33.6 GB per \nuser per month, and seeing a lot of traction in these seasons currently as well. \n \nOverall data and voice traffic grew by 19.5% and 3.8% year on year respectively. Coming to \nthe revenue numbers, these are the RJIL quarterly financials, which grew to 30,018 crore in \nterms of revenues and 16,188 crore in EBITDA. That is close to 54% EBITDA margin for our \nconnectivity business and the growth has been fairly steady and continuous. And the full year \nnumbers for the connectivity business, RJIL, we ended the year at ₹ 1,14,000 crore of \noperating revenues and EBITDA of ₹ 61,233 crore, so both growing in the 14 to 16% range \nand again fairly steady and healthy growth delivered across the years over last several years. \nThe consolidated financials for Jio Platforms Limited, the first three columns are quarterly \nand then the full year numbers on the right two columns. Full year fiscal 2025 revenue and \n \n \n \n \n8 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nEBITDA growth of 17%, consistent EBITDA margins of 50% and this is after a whole bunch \nof initiatives that are currently being taken to grow our digital services or other service \nofferings that we are going to provide to customers, we are maintaining our EBITDA margin \nat 50%. Q4 revenues at ₹ 33,986 crore consol revenues, which is again close to 18% year-\non-year growth, and EBITDA at ₹ 17,000 crore, and profit after tax growth of 26% to ₹ 7,023 \ncrore. This was for the quarter Q4. \n \nWith that, I am going to hand over to Dinesh to give an update on the retail business. \n \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja 00:21:19 – 00:37:20 (Reliance Retail) \n \nHi, good evening, everyone. We will cover the business update on retail. \n \nSo if you look at the performance highlights, we had a very strong quarter with 16% growth \non a Y-o-Y basis. The revenue for full year was up 8% because the first half was slightly \nweak, but the second half, last quarter was good growth and even this quarter we have done \nvery well. Overall EBITDA grew at 9% for the full year, for the quarter it was 14%. EBITDA \nmargin from operations continues to expand; it was up 20 basis points on Y-o-Y basis. On \nthe quick commerce side, we continued to expand our hyper local deliveries. The number of \norders were up quarter-on-quarter 2.4 times. So that is a pretty significant scale-up that we \nhave been able to do in the last quarter. \n \nConsumer brands business is the fastest growing FMCG business in India. We have \nachieved almost ₹ 11,450 crore of sales in the second year of operations. We also did the \ncommercial launch of SHEIN with the vision of providing global fashion to every Indian at \naffordable prices. It is live across app, website, as well as we have a shop-in-shop on our Jio. \nMore than 12,000 options are already available on the platform and we are scaling up the \nvendor ecosystem to have very quick launch, very quickly large number of options on the \nplatform. We opened 2,659 stores during the year. We continue to expand stores across the \nportfolio. We are also pretty much done with the streamlining that we had started during the \nyear. So our net addition is about 500 stores and we are pretty much more or less done with \nthe streamlining now. \n \nAll our operating metrics, whether it is number of transactions, the registered customers, \neverything continues to grow in double digits. So overall a pretty healthy quarter. If we look \nat the breakup, revenue was up 16% for the quarter on a Y-o-Y basis. EBITDA from \noperations was up 15%, total EBITDA was up 14% and profit after tax was up 30%. When \nyou look at it on a full year basis, the revenue was up 8%, EBITDA from operations was up \n \n \n \n \n9 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n9%, and profit after tax was up 12%. So we have almost crossed 25,000 crore in EBITDA for \nthe full year, and 12,400 crore of PAT. Moving on to business updates across each of the \nbusinesses.  \n \nThe consumer electronics business, we had pretty healthy mid-single-digit growth like for like \ngrowth. The average bill values continues to grow. The average bill values were up 26% on \na Y-o-Y basis. Also we see our conversions improving substantially. There was a 200 basis \npoints improvement in conversions. With the early onset of summers, we saw very strong \ngrowth in sales of ACs. Even this quarter, April, has been pretty warm, and there is a \nprediction of this being a pretty hot summer, so AC will continue to grow rapidly.  \n \nOur rescue business, we had a 13% Y-o-Y on the growth in terms of the number of customers \nserved. We also continue to expand the number of service centres we have, as well as we \nlaunched the on-demand warranty services last three quarters back, so that is again \nsomething we are expanding. We have now launched out on-demand warranty services to \nmore than 300 cities.  \n \nGMD, which is our B2B and B2C business in electronics, it had a very healthy growth of 76% \non a Y-o-Y basis. We continued to expand our reach in terms of the merchant base, as well \nas expand the width of participation, right. So how many retailers are participating, how much \nthey are buying from us, all those metrics are showing a pretty healthy upswing.  \n \nOur own brands business, where we sell our own brands, not just in our stores, but even in \nthe distribution channel, that business, again, continues to grow very steadily. The business \nwas up 30% on a Y-o-Y basis. We are expanding the reach of the business. The merchant \nbase was up 60% on a Y-o-Y basis.  \n \nWe launched several new products across multiple brands, multiple categories to plug the \ngaps, as well as new features. There are some products where we are bringing new features \nto the market. These are the first in the market. And compared with the price value \nproposition, they are finding very strong uptick with the consumers.  \n \nOn the fashion lifestyle side, while the first half was weak, the business has really turned \naround very well. We had positive LFLs during the quarter. The performance was quite \nsteady, led by the wedding season and festivals. We have been working on repositioning \nsome of our formats. So Trends, we did a large campaign, New Times, New Trends to really \nreposition the format within the younger audience, as well as the family audience. AZORTE, \nwhich is a Gen Z focused, tech enabled format, there we again did our targeted campaign \nwith a couple of celebrities. \n \n \n \n \n10 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nSo the effort is to establish these brands and have top of mind recall for the gen Z customers. \nIn addition, we are upgrading our stores. So Trends 3.0, which we have talked about, which \nis an upgraded version of our Trends store, are more digitally enabled version. So that is \nsomething we are scaling up. We are renovating a lot of our stores to upgrade them to have \nthe latest technology. And also support that with better in-store experience, not just in terms \nof technology, which is available, but in terms of number of options people see.  \n \nSo we have moved on with Project Impetus, which we have talked about in the past, where \nwe are talking of a design-to-shelf cycle of 30 days. We are now doing weekly refreshes in \nthe store, so every time a customer walks in, they get a certain percentage of options which \nare new. Also, we have kind of optimized the number of options which are available so the \nstores are less crowded and they look much more attractive. Now, as a result, our sales are \ngoing up while the inventory is going down. So that is a very good sign for the business. We \nhave also spent a lot of effort on improving the design quotient of our products and our own \nbrands. The contribution was up 900 basis points on a Y-o-Y basis. Specifically, some of our \nlarge and well-known brands, including NetPlay and Avaasa, they were the best performers \nduring the quarter. \n \nMoving on to our online fashion businesses, Ajio delivered a very steady quarter. We continue \nto increase the average bill values, as well as add new customers. We added 1.9 million new \ncustomers during the quarter, which is in line with what we have been adding almost every \nquarter. The number of options available on the platform now is 2.4 million, up 44% on a Y-\no-Y. External brands are the ones which drive traffic onto the platform, so their share was up \n11% and our focus continues to bring more and more exclusive and external brands which \nare able to get the customer pull and drive traffic onto the platform. We have also launched \nsame day and next day delivery across 26 cities. So we are increasing the speed at which \nwe are able to deliver the products. One big benefit of that is the returns are directly correlated \nas your time to delivery goes down, returns goes down and we are seeing that very clearly in \nour data.  \n \nThe All-Star Sale, which is a flagship event for March. In March, most of the online platforms \ngo on sale. This is the time where we acquire a lot of customers. We had a big event, and we \nadded 6 lakh plus new customers during this campaign. We talked about the SHEIN launch, \nwhich we have done during the quarter as well.  \n \nOn the premium brand side, the focus is growing the omni channel presence, a lot of bridge \nto luxury brands customers do not necessarily always prefer to come to the store. They want \nto come to you. So there is a meaningful 8% contribution that is coming from out-of-store \n \n \n \n \n11 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nselling. So we are basically going to the customer's home or letting them order online, and \nthen we are delivering to their homes. So that is seeing a very good acceptance amongst the \ncustomers, and this part is becoming quite meaningful. \n \nWe launched another very interesting accessible luxury ready to wear women's brand, a \nFrench brand called Maje during the quarter. We have launched our first store in Jio World \nDrive.  \n \nOn Vision Express, which is our JV with EssilorLuxottica in the eyewear space, we've kind of \nre-pivoted the go-to-market strategy. We are launching global new concept stores, as well as \nrenovating a lot of existing stores and the product offering in order to really scale up this \nbusiness. There is a large market opportunity here.  \n \nAjio Luxe which is the largest platform for luxury and premium brands, we continue to add \nnew brands and new options into the portfolio. The total count of brands now there is about \n800. The option was up 19% on a Y-o-Y basis.  \n \nOn the jewels business, we had steady growth led by increase in average bill values. As you \nare aware, the gold prices have increased substantially, which has had an impact on the \naverage bill values, which are up almost 20% on Y-o-Y basis. Our differentiator has been \nlaunched targeted campaigns, which are collections which target specific occasions, design \nthat offering. That continues to do well.  \n \nWe have developed a number of properties over the last several years, and some of those \ncollections like Valentine’s Day, Hoop and Bali collections were very well received during the \nquarter.  \n \nGrocery was the star performer during this quarter with the highest growth. The stores \nbusiness continues to outperform with industry-leading performance. \n \nSome of the premium formats, including Freshpik and Gofresh, where we provide \ndifferentiated assortment and shopping experience, are finding very good acceptance. And \nin the affluent areas, we are launching more and more premium stores. The growth was quite \nbroad based across categories. The general merchandise and value apparel have a \nmeaningful contribution, especially in our big buck stores. And they are a big driver of margin. \nAlso, there is strong demand for niche and premium products. These are the products which \ndrive a lot of footfall into the stores, especially the younger customers, because these brands \nare not available anywhere else. We are able to take them to pan India, and it is a win-win \n \n \n \n \n12 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nfor the brand, as well as for the customer and for us it drives a lot of traffic, especially the \nyounger ones, into the stores.  \n \nThe B2B business metro continues to have steady growth, again, pretty broad-based growth \nacross categories.  \n \nOne of the segments that we have identified within B2B is the HoReCa segment, where we \nare putting a lot of focus that segment had a 37% growth on a Y-o-Y basis.  \n \nJioMart it has basically three services. There is an under-30-minute quick service. There is a \nscheduled delivery, where the assortment is much wider, and then there is subscription \nservice, where you can subscribe and every day you get, depending on the frequency you \nchoose, we deliver the goods at your home early morning. All three are picking up very well. \nThe average daily orders were up 62% on a Y-o-Y basis. Specifically our under 30-minute \noffering, which has the widest network reach. We have almost 2,000 plus stores which are \non the network, covering more than 4,000 plus pin codes. So this is much wider reach than \nany other quick commerce player. We have kind of re-pivoted our model completely to under \n30 minutes delivery.  \n \nAnd we are seeing very strong traction with a 2.4X quarter and quarter growth in daily exit \norders. And this number will scale up substantially in the coming year as well. We are also \nnow starting to proactively market this proposition, our proposition of no hidden charges, \nquick delivery, and no delivery fees continues to resonate very well with the customers. We \nalso launched the quick and scheduled tabs if you go to the JioMart app. There are two \nseparate tabs. So that customer is very clear what is available under 30 minutes. So that \nassortment under 30 minutes if you want, there is that assortment which gets delivered from \nthe nearest store that is what you see. If you choose scheduled delivery, you get a much \nwider assortment and you can get the delivery for those the next day they may come from a \nwarehouse or from a 3P seller. So that proposition is very clear for the customer. The big \nadvantage that we have in this segment is compared to other people who have to set up \ndedicated store infrastructure. For us, we are only leveraging the infrastructure that we \nalready have. My fixed cost is already being taken care of by my store sales. This is all \nincremental sales and it is only incremental cost that I have to incur to deliver these orders. \nSo we are doing this model in a profitable manner with a very strong unit economics.  \n \nIn addition to our 1P offerings, 3P seller base, in order to plug the gaps, we continue to add \n3P sellers onto the platform. The number of 3P sellers was up 22% on a Y-o-Y basis. Live \nselection was up 10% on a Y-o-Y basis. Similarly, our subscription service continues to see \n \n \n \n \n13 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nstrong growth. We had a 27% growth Y-o-Y on daily orders and 37% growth in apps and web \nvisits. \n \nConsumer brands, it is on a very, very exciting trajectory, the business is growing from \nstrength to strength. We did almost ₹ 11,500 crore of turnover during the year. More than \n60% of that comes from general trade, so the brands are very, very widely distributed. If we \nlook at some of our key brands, like Campa and Independence, they are all growing very \nrapidly. Campa has already gained double-digit market share in the key markets where we \nare available. We also continue to add to our portfolio by launching new products and \nacquiring new interesting brands. Some of the notable acquisitions we have done in the year \ninclude SIL, Velvet, which is a personal care brand, and Tags. We have also launched several \nnew products. So with Campa, we have launched Campa Energy. And with Muttiah \nMuralitharan, we have launched a new sports drink called Spinner. Our distribution network \nis already quite wide, and it is expanding pretty rapidly as well. We are present across 1 \nmillion plus retail outlets through a network of 3,200 plus distributors. \n \nIn addition to tapping the Indian market, we have also started looking at exports to other \nmarkets, and we would basically start at that, and we would set up distribution in select \nmarkets to really distribute our products where they have the relevant appeal in a pretty big \nway. That is the update on the retail business. Now I will hand over to Kevin for the JioStar \nbusiness. \n \n \nSh Kevin Vaz 00:37:27 – 00:45:55 (JioStar) \n \nThank you and good evening everyone. \n \nOur business at JioStar is barely five months old. So what I am going to do is I am going to \nshare with you what we have been up to for the last five months. I hope each and every one \nof you all have downloaded the Jio Hotstar app and are enjoying it. \n \nJust to give you a perspective, this was coming together of two iconic brands, Viacom 18 and \nDisney Star. And on today's date, we have created India's largest media and entertainment \nplatform. This platform is built on three business units. The digital entertainment business, \nthe sports unit, and the TV broadcast. I will talk to each of them. If I look at the digital \nentertainment platform, within a short period of three months, we went and launched \nJioHotstar, the merger got completed on November 14th. On February 14th is when we went \nand launched JioHotstar. And we transferred a robust library of 320,000 hours of content onto \nthe platform. \n \n \n \n \n14 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nIn addition, we added 250 originals or exclusive titles, which is the highest among any of our \ncontemporaries. And thirdly, and most important thing is this will be the only platform in the \nworld that would have all the biggest American studios to be on a single plot platform where \nyou have their movies and series coming on one single platform whether it is from Marvel to \nHBO whether it is Warner to Disney or it is Peacock to Paramount you will have all the content \non a single platform. \n \nThis platform of ours, when you look at the width of content that we have, actually appeals to \nthe entire family across India. And more important, it is not about reaching out to families \nacross India but within a family, we have content for each and every individual, whether it is \nwhere you have two iconic brands, Disney and Nickelodeon or for the youth kids, where you \nhave two iconic brands, Disney and Nickelodeon or for the youth segment, where we have \nsome of the biggest reality shows or nonfiction shows, whether it is Big Boss, whether it is \nKhatron Ke Khiladi, Coffee with Karan or Laughter Chef on a single platform. For the women \nof the household, we have got some of the most iconic brands whether it is Anupamaa or I \nam saying is if you look at it, it is Mangal Lakshmi okay? And then for the males, we have got \na whole lot of sporting players.  \n \nIf I look at our sports portfolio across TV and digital, we have around about 24 sports \nchannels. And in today's date, we are the home to the best marquee properties on cricket, \nwhether it is ICC, whether it is IPL or BCCI, but also home to the biggest domestic leagues, \nthe Pro Kabaddi League or the Indian Super League, and also high-end sports or premium \nsports, which is the Premier League and Wimbledon. Lastly, on the TV broadcast business, \nwe have a very robust TV broadcast business with over 100 channels in 10 different \nlanguages actually reaching out to around about 358 million viewers every day. \n \nIf I look at it between these businesses, we reach out on a monthly basis to over 800 million \npeople every month. So I spoke a lot about, I am saying, is entertainment I spoke about sports \nbut we at JioStar look at creating delightful experiences for our consumers. And I am saying \non the 26th of Jan is when we started bringing up live experiences, where we started \nstreaming live shows. Coldplay was one example, 100,000 people enjoyed Coldplay live at \nthe Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. What JioHotstar managed to do, is to take this \nto millions of fans, to their living rooms, and let them enjoy the same live experience in their \nliving room across the country. Besides that I am saying is we have gone and done two big \nevents on Mahashivratri and Ram Navami. And if you look at the numbers for each of these, \nwe looked at 82 million views coming up for Ram Navami. We had Ram Navami, which was \nthrough multiple feeds so people could view the arti through multiple feeds not from a single \nlocation. At the same time, they could see something in Ayodhya, Chitrakoot or Panchwati. \n \n \n \n \n15 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nSo now, I am saying all this content, what does it deliver for us? I spoke about the width of \nthe content. These are the numbers, okay? Within a short period of three and a half months, \non today's date, we have got 280 million paid subscribers. Actually, we put this in perspective. \nWe are very close to I am saying is globally we are very close to Netflix, which gets this from \nacross the world. We generate I am saying is we have 503 million I am saying is users who \ncome to our platform on a monthly basis significant of any of our competition. \n \nAnd lastly, as Srikanth was mentioning, if I look during the India-New Zealand final for the \nChampions Trophy, we managed a concurrency, and when I say concurrency, it is people \ncoming and watching at the same time, right? This is a world record where we have 61 million \npeople watching a sport at the same time and that shows the strength of the platform. \n \nIf I have to put it into perspective for you many of us might know of the Super Bowl in the US. \nLet me tell you, their peak concurrency could be one fourth of it. And I think this show that \npeople in spite of having 61 million, we had a seamless, I am saying is viewership for each \nof these consumers that came on. On TV, we have got a 34% market share. And our content \nlibrary of 320,000 hours of content is actually six times that of a Netflix or an Amazon. Just \nfrom an operational point of view, we launched, as I mentioned, we launched JioHotstar app \nwith the best features from both the legacy apps. We seamlessly migrated 500 million-plus \nusers and a massive content library within three months. In TV, we lead in seven out of the \neight markets that we have across the country. And we are clearly focused to be present \nacross a billion screens, whether it is TV, mobile or CTV in this country. On the back of IPL, \nmany people talk about pay television dying in this country, et cetera. But remember, in this \ncountry, pay television is still in excess of 100 million and still growing. During the IPL, in the \nfirst ten days of the IPL, we grew by around 1.5 million I am saying households and we expect \nthat to hit at least three to five by the end of it.  \n \nLastly, I am saying is that is how we are putting this to just translate it. What does all this \nmean into numbers? The biggest part was this merger was consummated in less than nine \nmonths a merger of this scale.  \n \nOur revenue if I have to look at it for the period because it is a very short period I have taken \nfrom the time we launched is 9,497 crore with a EBITDA of 266 crore.  \n \nWe have had robust financial performance, keeping in mind, in spite of the weak \nmacroeconomic situation that is there. We have had higher sports revenue led by ICC Trophy \nas well as IPL. And despite the headwinds, we have kept a very close eye on our costs and \n \n \n \n \n16 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nto ensure that we have profitability and have positive financials for this period. Thank you. \nThat is all from my end. I shall now hand over to Sanjay. \n \n \nSh Sanjay Barman Roy 00:46:03 – 00:52:19 (Oil & Gas) \n \nGood evening, everyone.  \n \nThanks Kevin.  \n \nAlright, just to recap the performance for the year gone by. So this has been by far the \nstrongest year in terms of performance from the oil and gas business. If you look at the year-\non-year consolidated EBITDA, it has been almost 1,000 crore higher than the previous year, \nwhich had at that time set the best performance.  \n \nThe EBITDA margins still remain very healthy at 84% largely driven by higher production, 4% \nproduction from KGD6, as well as stable prices. We did have the benefit of $10.16 a ceiling \nprice in the second half of the year, as well as in CBM, we have completed the first campaign \nof the 40 multilateral wells that has augmented production. We now are seeing a turnaround \nin our CBM business. It had been declining for quite some time, but now progressively the \nproduction keeps increasing with the multilateral wells, which has been an innovation of sorts. \nIt is the first time horizontal multilateral wells have been done in India and successfully \ndeployed in the field. And we are getting significant upside in production.  \n \nWe were looking at about 4,000 standard cubic meters of gas production from the verticals, \nbut we are seeing about 12,000 to 13,000 now. So that is really the benefit we are getting out \nof these multilateral wells. This is a recap of the last quarter, the quarter gone by. \n \nAgain, the quarter was a little bit more muted as compared to the first three quarters only \nbecause production from KGD6. There was a little bit of natural decline on expected lines but \nmore importantly, we had to undertake a lot of maintenance activities towards the end of the \nquarter. \n \nOne of the things is we thought, let us complete these activities, particularly the FPSO had \nto take a planned shutdown for undertaking these maintenance activities, but now all the \nwells are back up on stream and we are back to ramping up the production to about 28 million \nstandard cubic metres. Similarly, CBM, we have commenced the second campaign, so the \nproduction from those will also be seen as we go along.  \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nOverall, if you look at the price realisations in KGD6, it has been slightly better year on year, \nquarter on quarter. And in CBM it has been slightly lower, again driven by the Brent prices \nbut nevertheless, the positive aspect about CBM is that it does not have a price ceiling, so \nyou get market link prices. So how does the global gas market look? I think, largely we have \nseen prices hover in the range of $10-14. There has been a push and pullover there in terms \nof supply and demand on one end, because of potentially weaker economies, we have seen \nthe demand being a little tepid, but at the other end of the anvil you have Europe, where the \ninventory levels are much lower, so the refill is a focus area.  \n \nIndia demand remains robust, I will talk about it in the next slide, but going forward also what \nwe had expected is the LNG glut to come in, as you may be all aware, about 150 million \ntonnes per annum of LNG was expected to be brought online from end 2025 onwards and \nprogressively over the next two to three years. So we expected there might be a strong \npullback in prices, but seeing the delays, again the Biden administration to that extent about \n20 to 30 million tonnes per annum of projects were put on hold.  \n \nAnd the other projects have faced regulatory delays, like in Corpus Christi and some of the \nmajor projects, also in Canada. So we feel that it may not be as exacerbated as we had \nanticipated. The projects may come online, but it should get the gas outlook being what it is. \nThe demand, particularly in the developing nations would be such that it should be absorbed \nwell enough in the next three to four years. So that is really the broad outlook. And so going \nforward, we think we should be on steady ground for gas prices. There will be some amount \nof volatility, but we feel from an Indian market standpoint, it should be all right.  \n \nSo just to give you a recap of the Indian gas market, it looks pretty strong. The demand has \nbeen up by almost 4%, largely driven by city gas distribution and some of the petchem \nexpansions. And again, it is the city gas distribution both in terms of expansion and \npenetration. \n \nSo that is largely contributed out of the eight MMSCMD, nearly four MMSCMD has been \ndriven by CGD. We are also observing a trend that the LNG markets, the long-term contracts \nare being pursued rather than short-term. And so essentially gas for the longer term, the \ndemand looks pretty strong and vibrant in India. The ceiling price also, as you may be all \naware is now being revised to $10.04 cents. And we are contracted for the volume, so we \nare all right there. Thank you and I will invite Srikanth. Thank you. \n \n \nSh V. Srikanth 00:52:31 – 01:14:19 (Oil to Chemicals, New Energy and Summary) \n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo starting with the financials, EBITDA lower by 12%. You will see in the slides, but anything \nfrom 36-41% fall in transportation fuel and between 2 and 13% when you look at polymer and \npolyester clearly led by Chinese capacity, slowdown in demand.  \n \nTo a great extent, there was some offsets coming because of the fact that India demand was \ngood, 7.5% for gasoline, ATF was about 9%, both polymer and polyester demand up 5%. We \nplaced a lot through Jio-bp and in the subsequent slide I will talk to you about how impactful \nit was overall.  \n \nWe also benefited from operational excellence. This was the highest throughput that we have \ndone in this refinery. And then, of course, the continuing benefit from cost optimization, \nethane cracking economics worked well. And this is the slide. This tells the full story on \ngasoline, gas oil, and ATF.  \n \nWhen you look at year-on-year change and you look at where it was vis-à-vis five years, \nanywhere between 25-27% lower in the case of gas oil, gasoline, and ATFs about 13%. \n \nThe reasons are known in terms of demand and both China, EU, multiple places, driving \nseason was slow in the US. Similarly when you look at on the downstream petrochemical \nside, naphtha was up 4% but ethane prices were lower by 9% so that benefited us because \nthe deltas were squeezed when you compare it to naphtha, but to the extent we had lighter \nfeed cracking it helped. But the numbers on PE, PPP, PVC, tell you the story of what a 15, \n20 year low means in terms of this environment. So it has been a more difficult one.  \n \nAgain, capacity additions primarily the big driver and then of course demand also being soft. \nSo this is what I was saying in terms of what helped mitigate this otherwise difficult margin \nenvironment, whereas volume growth in Jio-bp you can see 35% higher when you look at \nMS and HSD. ATF up about 62%. Of course, e-mobility is small, but you can see the jump in \npercentages there. And even if you look at our market share now in motor spirits about 3.3, \nin gas oil about 5.2. And importantly, the effectiveness that you see, the market effectiveness \nyou can see the score. Per retail outlet, you can see that the effectiveness of each of these \npumps is very strong. So it is 1.6, it is 2.6 actually in the case of HSD. And this is something \nthat we would continue to expand in the coming year or more. It is 1,916. There is no reason \nwhy it has to be this level. It can be much higher than that. This is the throughput I talked to \nyou about, highest ever at 80.5. \n \nOverall, all the products, so this 2.5% benefit did help mitigate this margin environment. \nOverall, you look at the throughputs were absolutely maximized in platformers and FCC. The \naromatic production that optimization always happens that we continue to do focused on high \n \n \n \n \n19 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \noctane exports, because from the value point of view and continuing benefit from gasification \nhelped the overall performance. And this is just the numbers for the quarter. Again, story not \nvery different in terms of margins being weak, but there were some offsets while fuel was \ndown between 27 and 55% and the whole polyester chain was down. You did see some \noffsets in the form of polypropylene slightly higher by 4%.  \n \nPVC helped at about 13% and then the whole PBR, SBR about 10 to 15%. So also, as I \nmentioned, the whole focus obviously was also on processing the right value of crudes, trying \nto derive advantage from the value adds coming from crude processing, domestic \nplacements continued as a point, some small lift from sulphur prices which really went through \nthe roof and some benefit of exchange rate when you look at it from a rupee earnings point \nof view.  \n \nThis I will not spend too much time. You know the broader environment. Brent did come off \non a year-on-year basis on concerns on tariff, etc. Of course, on a quarter-on-quarter basis \nthe story on ethane was higher because it was up 42% overall versus last year. Having said \nthat, still the cracking economics were pretty favorable and both the refining operating rates \nand the cracker operating rates were fairly stable.  \n \nWhen you look at the demand environment, it rose by about 1.2, geographically if you see, it \nis in Asia, about 0.4, and OECD America is another 0.4. When you look at it from a product \nstandpoint, gasoline was about 0.4 million barrels per day growth, and balance in diesel. \nAgain you can see the stock fall in the delta's $6 cracks versus 13.3.  \n \nAnd China, clear reason with the increasing EV penetration also led to some extent by \ninventory levels were pretty high. The fact that India gasoline demand helped upgrowing 6%. \nSo we continue to focus, as I said, on domestic placement and pushing more volumes here. \nAnd we think near term cracks could find some support.  \n \nGas oil again cracks you can see a significant fall, $14 versus 23.1. Again more led by \ninventories that we saw in Singapore and more exports from the Middle East demand, \nactually if you see it vis-a-vis other products. India demand was up only about 1.1%. Again \nthe actions were broadly similar in terms of focusing on the domestic market and again some \nof the supply disruption kind of concerns can keep the cracks at least stable here.  \n \nAnd ATF fell in line actually you can say with what we saw in gas oil. Demand for ATF has \nbeen good in India and you saw the volume growth in Jio-BP pretty stronger. And we are \nexpecting that these margins stay. \n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nAnd quick ones on each of the individual products with P, this decreased by 10%. Domestic \ndemand has been good. Again, we are trying always to see how much can we maximize light \nfuel cracking here. And the drivers for domestic demand still remains good and we do expect \nthat to stay. \n \nOn PPE, again, delta is slightly up 4%, demand continuing to do well and again, it is a story \nof domestic placement. Actually this whole focus on domestic also plays into the same point \nthat I said. Otherwise if you did not have a domestic exposure like this, I think in this \nenvironment it could have been pretty difficult.  \n \nAnd finally on PVC side that improved because of EDC prices being low and so we saw a lot \nof lift there in terms of year-on-year delta increase. Demand continues to be fairly good in as \nfar as agri and infra is concerned. And do not expect too much of surprises there from a \ndomestic demand point of view.  \n \nAnd finally, on the polyester chain, that is a big chain for us and it was down 15%, mainly due \nto decline in PX prices and the downstream polyester prices, margins did go up but in the \ncontext of what happened in PX, overall the numbers were still lower and we continue to \noptimize PX versus gasoline. And overall again, when you look at polyester demand, if you \nrecall we used to always track this high cotton versus PSF. That differential remains \nattractive, so demand should hold there. \n \nThese are projects that we had talked about, but just putting it there in terms of 1 million tonne \nexpansion for polyester. And the difference is that it is focused on the high growth consumer \nand downstream market. And if you see this specifics on active wear, athleisure, hygiene \ndenim. So these are products which can also command a higher premium. So that's where \nthe focus is and then it is integrated with backward integration with three million tonne PTA \nfacility that is also planned.  \n \nSo in essence, and all these factories will be state of the art and it is got, you know, ensuring \nthat the infrastructure is pretty good from an overall cost effectiveness and efficiency on \ncapex. So projects are there. So we are thinking about this project and of course the next \none on PVC also to see the benefit of all this coming in 2027-2028 in terms of its contribution \nto the EBITDA. And this is the PVC one. This is a more integrated one with caustic chlorine \nand EDC, both in Dahej and then VCM and PVC in Nagothane and then CPVC in Dahej. \n \nAgain, this as you know is a product where India is significantly short even as we talk. It is a \n2 to 2.5 million tonne shortage and we think that possibly it is the right time to be investing \n \n \n \n \n21 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nhere. And these are the basic updates on the vinyl chain and you can see some of the pictures \nthat we have on the visuals on the land that is acquired near Dahej.  \n \nConstruction is commissioned 2026-2027 but financial is coming in 2027-2028. So overall \nthe focus was always on maximizing margin capture, focus on crude procurement, on getting \nmore and more ethane, focusing on the domestic retail sector, as well as industrial sectors. \nWe are trying to do a lot of things on freight cost through term charter vessels because one \naspect is that the deltas are weak, but what can we do differently in terms of ensuring that \nwe are able to negate, if not fully, but yes, you can squeeze out efficiency. So these are things \nthat we are focusing on. \n \nLarger parcels by converting crude tankers to product services focus on recycled PET which \nwe have been talking about and of course both the polyester and the PVC expansion should \ngive us volume lift in 2027-2028 earnings. So, not a very detailed  \n \nupdate, but just to give you some of them in terms of the 10 gigawatt per annum capacity that \nwe have for solar and importantly, it is designed in such a way that it is quick, we can quickly \njump it up to 20 gigawatts, so that is an important point there. We are also focused on 30 \ngigawatts of battery manufacturing. So this is essentially cells to pack, and then you integrate \nit into a BSS system but that is the whole aspect there.  \n \nAgain, when I talk solar, I just want to remind everybody that it is polysilicon to ingot to wafer \nto cell to panel and then of course glass and as well as POE polyolefin elastomer. So when \nwe say it is integrated, we are absolutely integrated from end to end there. So here if you see \nwhere we are, we have commissioned the first gigawatt scale solar module started. So we \nstarted, it is BIS certified already and I would say, the largest from a size point of view at 720 \nwatt peak. It is possibly the largest panel that we have. So that is already commissioned. And \noverall, when you see in each of these, on the entire solar chain, the engineering is complete, \nthe long lead items and procurements are complete and construction is going on in full swing. \nSo I just wanted you to know and this is just one part of what is coming up. And the other one \nis battery also will come in. We have talked a lot about renewable electricity generation, if \nyou were to see. \n \nAnd you know what the access to the land in the Kutch region. \n \nAnd the land, it is arid land and importantly, the solar radiation is pretty good there. So that \ncan fundamentally support almost 150 billion units of electricity. So it is a very large one. And \nas these panels start getting ramped up, the idea is to lift and shift them as and when those \nthat area is ready for it to. So all of them are going on. There again, we have international \n \n \n \n \n22 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nfirms as well as local contractors to obviously level the land and so on so. Work has already \nstarted and dedicated transmission line again from Jamnagar here. So a lot of things are \nhappening essentially in parallel in such a way that this whole thing comes together. In Kandla \nwe have 2,000 acres of land that we have got. And that is where the green hydrogen \necosystem can come in. And before that, electrolyzer, if you recall, with Nel we are in the \nprocess of that electrolyzer manufacturing also, work is going on. So what is unique, I think, \nabout bringing it is there has been no end-to-end like this. We have not seen, at least in our \nmind, we have not seen anybody who is doing end-to-end like this. I mean, when you start \nwith solar and battery and both of them integrate well for renewable energy. So, this kind of \nintegration, and therefore if you were to say hydrogen, where are you going to get the green \nenergy from? That integration is very interesting. And importantly what was plans, we used \nto talk about doing it. \n \nNow with the commencement of solar production and I will show you some pictures, I think I \nhave them, you can see that. And these factories are huge. I mean, it is built on 5,000 acres \nso you can imagine that. I guess at some stage, we will all get the opportunity to go and see \nit. But I am just saying that a lot of work has happened, and the uniqueness comes from \nintegration. The uniqueness comes from the fact that it is scaled. The fact that the factories \nare absolutely state of the art. So what it means for us is if there is cost efficiency, there is \ntechnology efficiency, so when we say what is the cost of producing the final product, there \nis significant confidence that this is way more attractive than what it would be for anybody to \nimport anything into this country. So we are pretty more confident about where those numbers \nare. So it also means that sooner rather than later we may see that the need for us to leverage \non the modular aspect of saying if it is 10 we can take it to 20. So we have now the confidence. \nAnd this is just one aspect of it. Then of course the CBG plans that are there. \n \nJust a quick one on the photographs in terms of where we are. I talked to you about the \ncommissioning of a gigawatt line with the largest module size of 720. I do not know whether \nyou have seen the sizes of other ones, but by far in our minds I think it is the largest, but yes. \nYou can see the commissioning, the electro-luminescence inspection, the packaging which \nis all automated, the edge trimming, the junction box mounting, back support bar placement, \nthe automated guided vehicle. So that you may recall our adverb investment. So these AGVs \nare from them. This is this part of the integration, but it also ties in well with the battery \nmanufacturing facility. So it is a very state-of-art manufacturing shop that we have there. It is \nall on HJT, efficiency is much higher, and people ask about it and you will see that the \nnumbers are pretty good there, so I am happy there. \n \nAnd overall on CBG, we have 10 plants operational we want to scale it up quickly to 55. It \nhas been proved well. Cumulatively it is 200 tonnes per day of production and once you take \n \n \n \n \n23 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nit to 55 it starts becoming meaningful. And overall these are the plants in which it is there. \nAnd we signed recently with MOU with Andhra, so that gives you access to significant amount \nof land and use of specialized grass for creating the CBG. So yes, just to summarize, if you \nsee the context, I think the performance context of the world and context of the environment, \nit is strong. And also we benefited from the fact that India held well, demand was good, and \nof course our assets and our operations have kept us in a very good place. Jio has been the \nstar performer at something like 18% growth. That is pretty impressive. Overall, it is beyond \ndoubt leadership in the network, the number of customers, 5G customers, ARPU. I mean, \nyou see any operational metrics, it has done pretty well. And we have growth drivers from \nmobility. We have it from enterprises, from home. On the retail, we kept flagging that, yes we \nare going through this process of streamlining our operations. We went through the pain of \nthree quarters, but starting last quarter and again this quarter, I think the buoyancy is good \nand we remain very confident about how those numbers will pan out in the coming quarters \nand year. \n \nAnd the brands which we talked about, that I think it is a very good story if you see in what \ntime frames you have achieved the kind of numbers. And I think there is huge value to be \ncreated in that branch. Overall, again on refining and petrochemicals, as I said doing our very \nbest by focusing on all the operational part but I think broadly, slowly, the refining outlook is \ngetting more stable. The additions to refinery capacities are kind of hopefully slowing down. \nAnd our new bouquet of new businesses like media and new energy and AI-ready data \ncenters give you a lot of lift to potentially where are the new sources of earnings. With this, I \nam bringing the presentation to an end. \n \n \nQ&A SESSION 01:14:47 – 01:55:02 \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nFirst, thank you for the presentation. Maybe I will have two questions for Anshuman and one \nfor Kevin. Anshuman like Jio's had a phenomenal 5G ramp-up but why do you think, despite \nthis phenomenal performance in 5G, the market share gains have sort of come off? And also, \nJio led the tariff hike. And despite this quarter's ARPU actually coming ahead of expectation, \nwhy do you think the ARPU is still 15% lower than the number two operator? That is the first \nquestion. \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nLook we have had very good success with our 5G deployment and the proof of the pudding \nis in the data consumption trends, where we continue to expand the gap between us and the \nother operators. The fixed wireless numbers you have seen the TRAI data coming. Why the \n \n \n \n \n24 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \ntariff increase? I think I would urge all of you to look at the way ARPUs are getting computed. \nSo this 15% ARPU gap, when you say, if you just break that up into the reporting basis, so \nlook at the denominator in our case, which is the overall subscriber base, the TRAI reported \nsubscriber base and look at the denominator in the case of the nearest rival, which is not that \nbase, which is a different base. So you are no longer comparing like to like. We come across \ninter-segmental kind of adjustments, and those are massive numbers. So it is really, again, \nonce again not comparable, because you are not looking at what is coming out of mobility \nrevenue versus a whole bunch of enterprise revenues getting intermingled and those \nnumbers could be of the order of 11 to ₹ 1200 crore every month or quarter. So we are not \ncomparing like to like. Our assessment tells us that on the smartphone side, where our tariffs \ntend to be 7-10% lower, we still have ARPUs which are slightly higher. If you do a strict like \nto like comparison. I will let you people do it and give this task to you because normally we \nhave all the tasks and next quarter when we meet we will get into actually doing the numbers, \nbut our assessment is we are slightly higher or a little bit higher, despite the fact that our \ntariffs are lesser. And therefore, the flow-through of impact or any of that, I think we are fairly \nconfident that we are doing quite well. Our customers are using a lot of data. The higher \nARPU, despite our tariff plans being lesser, kind of indicate our customers are picking up the \nhigher plans and their premiums are more. The other bit around why the market shares have \nnot increased, they are increasing. They are increasing when you look at data consumption. \nThey are increasing when you look at actual customer traction on the network. And look \nagain, I will take you back to 2016. Finally, when the network can provide better service, \nbetter quality of service, can carry more load that will translate into more customers coming \nand enjoying superior services, and we do expect that to happen. The fact that we have \ndeployed 5G capacity, which is significantly ahead of the competitors, we believe the capacity \nmarket share will translate into data consumption market share, which is something that is \nalready happening and which will then translate into customer market share and revenue \nmarket share, which also we are seeing already beginning to happen and will only pick up as \nthe time goes by. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nSo you had an excellent acceleration in 5G FWA but that is still under 6 million while fiber \nhomes are 18 and you are reiterating your 100 million home target. Is that banking on 5G \nFWA acceleration? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo that is going to be a combination of what we are doing on AirFiber, which is where we \nhave seen a lot of good success in deployment now. The numbers have been ramping up. \nAnd the fact that we have been able to do that very successfully using both our 5G spectrum \nas well as the UBR radio gives us the confidence that the last mile challenges that we have \nfaced in the past while connecting customers, and we have faced quite a bit of challenges in \nthe last mile, which was kind of expected. It is not only a function of cost, but a function of \ntime really that we will be able to overcome by doing this wirelessly. And which is why we feel \nreasonably confident. Demand is there. Almost half of our FWA connections are coming from \ntier three, tier four cities and rural areas, so demand is fairly wide and prevalent. So if we are \n \n \n \n \n25 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nable to provide the service, we feel reasonably confident demand will be there and more than \n100 million homes definitely need that service today, many more than that. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nSo does the 100 million have a time frame? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nI am not going to give you forward looking, but yes it is. It is a plan. So it is a plan, so it will \nhave a timeframe internally. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nThank you. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nFrom my side first on the balance sheet side, RJIL your spectrum has been significantly \ndeployed now from the accounting perspective while it is not showing up in amortization. Did \nit happen somewhere in between during this quarter? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nWe have capitalized it during this quarter so most of the 5G equipment has been capitalized \ntowards the end of the quarter, so it would show up next quarter. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nAnd the same accounting rule applies, right, as the capacity utilization goes up? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThat is right, somewhat similar. So we are sitting with auditors. We have figured out, given \nthem the plans and on that basis we will be doing, like we did for LTE. So over a period of \ntime, it will get fully amortized. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSecond, this year we did a capex of ₹ 41,000 crore but that will include the creditor payout \nas well? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThat is right. \n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSo what was the underlying capex for this year and how do you see the capex going because \nwe are largely done with the 4G-5G capex, so how should we see the trajectory in the capex \nas a percentage of revenue? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo look most of the capex around the 5G network has been done. We have deployed 5G \nnow pretty much across the country. Coverage is fairly deep. There will still be some infills. \nThere will still be some areas where we will deploy 5G, but that is not going to be very \nsignificant. The network side capex that we needed to do for our fixed wireless as well is done \nmostly, but there will be a little bit of that capex. But we are through the big capex phase for \n5G deployment across the country. Now, really the expansion which is happening when we \nare connecting homes, the network side is done a fair bit, some bit remaining, but other than \nthat, when we are connecting a premise, effectively the customer is paying for the devices. \nSo the capex for Jio at least this phase of capex is mostly done now. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSo what should we look at capex going forward next year? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo I told you, there is not 5G to spend too much money on. We will still have to spend some \nmoney on 5G. And then there is going to be the routine maintenance and a little bit of infill. I \nwill not give you a number, but the bulk of the capex is done. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nSo 15-16% is something which is achievable as we know? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nYou will keep trying. I will keep rejecting. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nThanks for hosting this, Anshuman. So firstly, on the non Jio Infocomm revenues, which is \nnow approaching close to $2 billion, growing close to 40% year over year, what are like the \nsubparts of that business that are doing really well for you. And when you think about, let us \nsay within that piece of the business, the $2 billion, how much of that now would be, let us \nsay external customers versus internal group parties? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo on the first part we have a few services which have grown quite well. Cloud has grown \nquite well for us, enterprise cloud, as well as the cloud services, some of the government \ndepartments. Miraj project we have spoken about in the past as well that is scaling up. So \nCloud is something that is doing very well. We have also launched a consumer cloud offering. \nAnd that again, the uptick has been quite good. We are not charging for it today, but there \nwe are seeing good traction. The additional services that we provide to our consumers, both \non mobility and home content for example or some security solutions, those are picking up \nwell once again. And then, enterprise as a part of the overall group is beginning to grow. And \nenterprise is often a combination of two or three services. It is never pure connectivity. We \nare able to bundle in more things. So which again, as the enterprise part of our business \ngrows, you will see more of JPL, digital services revenues also coming in there because that \nis  normally not pure connectivity. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nCan you clarify what is that enterprise services? Like what is included in enterprise services? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nIt could be something else basic as some Cloud facility, the Microsoft Azure stack that we \nprovide to our enterprise customers. It could be security solutions it could be IoT based \nsolutions. So it could be a combination of things that we take to enterprises beyond just \nconnectivity. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nAnd just last question on this one, I mean, growth momentum obviously is like two times of \nyour connectivity business here? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThat is right. It is of a smaller base. \n \nManish Adukia \n \nBut from a growth perspective, this should continue to be a meaningfully faster growing piece \nthan the connectivity piece is that safe to assume? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nIt should, the market opportunity is there. We are very focused on it. And it is coming off a \nsmaller base, so percentage growth will look good. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo I have got three questions on the energy side. First is, in terms of your O2C performance \nhow much could have been contributed by Jio-bp alone during this quarter? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \n₹ 2,500 crore was the EBITDA for the year. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nFor the year for Jio-bp as a whole? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nYes. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nRight Sir and second question is on your polyester expansion that you have mentioned. So \nthis is a new announcement, right? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nWe said ₹ 75,000 crore we will spend when AGM speech this covered O2C projects, so this \nis part of it. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nFY2027 is the commissioning of the plant or commissioning of the project? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nNo, I said 2027-2028 you will see the benefit of the expansion in terms of earnings, etc. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nRight and it will be a full impact itself or there could be ramp-up then also? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nIt is too early to say that, but yes, we are determined to obviously get it done and try and see \nwhether it is a full year impact, but we will see. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n4 \nAnd last question is on new energy. You mentioned that the solar factory is like 10 gigawatt. \nSo you have commissioned a gigawatt line. So that is like close to 10 gigawatt? \n \n \n \n \n29 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nNo, no it is a part of the line. When you say gigawatt, it is 1 gigawatt or 1.2, that kind that is \nhow it comes. You roll out your production in phases like that. I mean, you do not start a full \n10 gigawatt line. So you will do it as 1 or 1.25. That is the way you scale it in. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nAnd you will be using the modules internally to build generation capacity in Kutch? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nThat is correct. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nYou have already acquired land there, and you are setting up transmission towers right now? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nYes absolutely. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nAnd solar generation is expected by what time? Solar power generation? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nSo if you think about overall generation wise again, it is fair to say 2027-2028, that is the kind \nof time frame by which anything meaningful will happen. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nAnd then it will be used captively? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nYes correct. \n \nSabri Hazarika \n \nThank you so much. \n \nProbal Sen \n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nHi Sir good evening Prabal here. Just a couple of questions again on oil and gas. Coming \nback to the Jio-bp mobility. The presentation mentioned about 1,900 outlets already \noperational so given the performance and the trends that we see in retail margins as of now \nare there any plans to aggressively expand that network to grab market share? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nThat is right, yes we have. Not mentioning the numbers, but obviously this kind of \nperformance also means that it makes sense for us to invest and we will expand that network. \n \nProbal Sen \n \nRight and the second question was on the upstream part of it, where you mentioned that \nthere is some decline that has been seen in terms of production. Obviously these are all \nmarginal fields that you have developed. So what kind of trend can we expect for the next \ncouple of years? And the second part I had was that is it at a stage where the government \nshare of profit petroleum is now slightly higher, and that also impacts the earnings for that \npart of the business? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nSanjay your area, you want to talk. He is trying very hard to arrest this pace of decline. \n \nSh Sanjay Barman Roy \n \nSo the fact is there is going to be a natural decline. Now, two things that we have observed \nis the performance is slightly better than expectations and we have also identified some \nupsides and we are working on those upsides and we are looking at doing some work over \njobs also to augment the production sometime next year. Also, we have identified a few \nadditional wells in the fields where we feel the reservoirs are not getting depleted. So those \nare things that we are trying to bring on stream. So yes, there will be a natural decline, but \nwe are trying to offset that and augment it with some of the activities that we expect to start \nfrom the middle of next year. What was the second part of the question? \n \nProbal Sen \n \nI was saying that the government share of profit petroleum has the investment multiple \nreached a stage where their share starts to really go up substantially over the next couple of \nyears? \n \nSh Sanjay Barman Roy \n \nNot as yet. I mean, it is still in a good place. So again, it all depends on the price realizations. \nObviously, we believe the production is good. But it is natural to expect when you are getting \nmore value, the share of profit petroleum may shift. But again, as of now, we do not see that \nshifting in the immediate term. \n \n \n \n \n31 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nProbal Sen \n \nOne last question, if I may, again on the expansion projects in the downstream that you \nmentioned. It is obviously part of the ₹ 75,000 crore. Is it possible to share the capex for the \nspecific expansions on PX and PTA, roughly? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nNot now, but yes, it is well below ₹ 75,000. Overall, maybe in the ₹ 60 to 65,000. But still, we \nare just putting that together. \n \nProbal Sen \n \nThank you very much. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nA question for Anshuman. Anshuman any thoughts on telecom tariff hot topic you had like \nonce in two years, once in one-and-a-half years now. Is it possible like to share and would \nyou say annual tariff hike is a possibility now? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nNo that is too speculative to talk about really. No guidance. Look, we will have to continue to \nsee how the market grows. For us, priorities are market growth. Priority is at this point in time \nmore 5G user base and traction. So that is not a thought currently crossing our minds for \nsure. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nOkay and another hot topic, any comment on IPO? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nWhat comment? Someday we will come and tell you now we are going to launch an IPO \nprocess. Before that, there is no comment. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nLike one on retail, so quick commerce any plans for 10 minute delivery, dark stores? How \nare you thinking about that? And are you seeing any impact of quick commerce in the metro \ncities? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo Dinesh spoke about that, but maybe you can summarize it again. \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja \n \nSee, two parts to it. We are looking at a sub 30 minute delivery right? So we are using our \nstore network, delivering within a three kilometer radius. So most of our areas, most of the \npin codes get covered. We have 4,000 pin codes where we are able to cover within that. \nThere are some dark pockets where we will set up dark stores also, wherever there is a \ngenuine requirement, there is enough volume and we cannot service it within 30 minutes, we \nmay set up some dark stores as well. So that is on the quick commerce side of it. Our stores, \npurely on a standalone basis, are seeing double digits like for like growths for last several \nquarters. So stores are also growing pretty rapidly. We are not seeing that impact either in \nmetro or in any other city. \n \nEven metro cities, our stores continue to grow in a pretty healthy manner. \n \nKunal Vora \n \nAnd lastly, if you can, let us say, talk about like overall capex for the company as a whole? \nShould we see a decline or how should we look at FY2026 capex? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nWe have been holding the capex pretty well, I thought. At least the big parts of somebody \nwas asking on Jio. I mean, it is pretty obvious now that that part of the capex growth, the big \nones have happened and now on it is going to be much smaller, some percentage of revenue \nyou were asking of it. I would like to believe it will go down, obviously. The other capexes on \nO2C which we talked about or known capexes which are part of the plan. New energy is also \ngive or take, we talked about ₹ 75,000 crores for setting up of the whole giga factory and \nbetween a combination of what we have spent and we have already committed, I think fair to \nsay that the entire ₹ 75,000 we are already in. The bigger ones will start coming in when you \nstart generating electricity, because then you are really taking the panels and generating. But \nthat is going into later further down. So overall capex looks in that sense within these \nboundaries that I talked to you about. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nOkay thank you for the opportunity for questions. We are just starting with the new energy \npart of the business. Can we talk about the next set of the timelines? When do we expect to \nhit 10 gigawatt module cell, polysilicon, and also where are we on the battery manufacturing? \nWe talked about the 30 gigawatt module, cell, polysilicon, and also where are we on the \nbattery manufacturing? We talked about the 30 gigawatt hour battery manufacturing capacity. \nWhere are we and what is the more realistic timeline we should think about for the ramp-up? \nAnd if you can also talk a little bit about the battery technology we are pursuing here. \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \n \n \n \n33 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nI am going to ask Kiran to answer this. I have all my colleagues from refining and pet chem, \nso very happy for Srinivas or Sridhar to answer some of these questions but specifically, \nKiran, why do not you take the floor? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nFirst question was on the timelines on the solar manufacturing, right? As Srikanth sir \nmentioned, we are very well progressing. The entire engineering has been done for the entire \nvalue chain, whether it is polysilicon, cell module, glass and POE. The equipment orders \nhave been placed and the construction is going on. I think we have defined that by end of \n2025, early 2026, all these factories will get commissioned and will start producing and we \nare well on our way to achieve that. The second question was on battery technology. It is \nlithium ion phosphate. It is a large format prismatic cells, which is for storage requirements, \nutility scale storage requirements. Again, very well progressing on that, the construction has \nalready started. So in 2026, you will start seeing, starting with packs and then going to the \ncells, the manufacturing. Again, it is a full entire value chain, including battery materials that \nwe are doing. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nThanks Kiran can you clarify, so the first batch will be the packing of the cells and then the \ncell assembly will happen roughly by what timeline? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nSo everything is progressing together. So it is just probably a matter of a quarter to two \nquarters. By the time you will start seeing container, pack, and then cell in that sequence, \neffectively. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nGreat. So that was in the new energy. If I can also ask a question on refining. So just more \nin terms of the environment of the crude discounting and the crude environment over the past \nyear versus what we expect in FY2026, the reason I am asking is, of course, we had an \nenvironment of high Russian crude discounts in the past couple of years, which appears to \nbe narrowing but at the same time, OPEC is releasing more barrels in the market. So net-\nnet, the crude discounting environment, do we expect to improve in FY2026 versus 2025 or \nrather stay flat or a little more tougher? Thank you. \n \nSh Sreedhar Rudraraju \n \nSee, when compared to two years back, we have seen correction to crude discounts. Crude \npremiums have gone up because as more and more new markets got diversified, so that \nsituation got corrected to a large extent. Being a complex refiner, we continue to enjoy decent \ncrude discounts when compared to the peer group. In general, AG premiums have slightly \n \n \n \n \n34 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \ncorrected with the ongoing easing out in terms of crude production because non-OPEC crude \nproduction is coming up in a significant way. If you see, we are seeing significant growth in \nnon-OPEC production from last year to this year. So that will put pressure on the AG crude \npremiums going down, which will help the Asian refiners. \n \nNikhil Bhandari \n \nIf I may, just last question. On chemical, we earlier talked about increasing our ethane \nsourcing mix. Where are we in terms of our feedstock mix right now, ethane, propane, and \nnaphtha and how does that mix change, and the timeline of implementing of the ethane mix \nand how does that change in the next one or two years? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nSo ethane mix is actually linked to our expansion projects on vinyls. We have already ordered \nthree new ships with the shipyards and they are likely to start getting delivered sometime in \n2026 second half. That is the timeline and then they are phased out over a period of time. \nAnd as I said, they are primarily meant that extra ethane is meant for the expansion project \nof the vinyls. Does that answer your question? \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nOn this PVC thing that we are putting up the project, this was actually supposed to be put in \nADNOC, right? That has been changed now to Dahej? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nYes. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nThat is the same one, right? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nIt is the same one. We shifted the whole project within India itself. So this will be at $2 dollar, \nthe sum remains same. We have added a couple of things we have added a CPVC element \nalso into it. We have added a RelWood element also into it, so it is become a wider project \nthan what it was. Of course the cost numbers also change because the cost factors in Abu \nDhabi were very different from what they are in India and the size of project has also actually \ngone up. So we were talking about a million tonnes of PVC there, we are now talking more \nthan 1.25. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nAnd how do we plan to consume the caustic because we will consume chlorine, we will sink \nchlorine in PVC. We will be ending up having 1.5, 1.6 million? \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nSo that is the advantage we have because this particular industry has a challenge of \nconsuming actually the chlorine. But we will be advantaged in that position that we will have \nchlorine consumption. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nYou can take entire industry into a disadvantage position because we will be having 25% of \nIndia's caustic production at one location. \n \nSh Amit Chaturvedi \n \nI mean I agree with you, there will be caustic surplus in the country and for a while for initial \nperiod of one or two years we will export some of that caustic and manage the situation. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nOne on battery, this LFP battery, we will be doing it all ourselves as in LFP production to \nbattery production, everything we will be doing? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAs I said it will be fully integrated from battery materials such as cathode, anode, electrolyte \nall the way to cell battery. And we will not be doing lithium carbonate production because that \neffectively goes into the mining. India does not have that rich resources. \n \nSanjesh Jain \n \nAnd we have a supply arrangement for the carbonates. \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nIt is a surplus market. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nTwo questions on telcos, one on the retail. On telco Anshuman clearly the tariff hikes we \nhave taken for Jio it is more back-end loaded as compared to other telcos. So should we \ncontinue to see benefit of tariff hikes in coming quarters or most of it is largely behind us? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nA little bit more because some of our annual plans are still quite popular and those impact \nwill flow through almost. The hike happened in early July so when the next recharge happens, \nthere will still be some impact of that. And we had also allowed customers to do stacking, \nthough people do not stack annual plans that much they do not do but some impact may still \nbe there. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nAnd commensurate margin improvement should be seen, right as in how RPU improves? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nYes, they should but look there are lots of combination of things which impact the margins \nthere. But this revenue increase should improve the margins. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nSecond question, telco vendor payables, how much is roughly the number right now? \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nThe vendor payables? Capex creditors now? \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nYes capex creditors. \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSort of we have other numbers. We have mostly taken credit now. It is all converted into \nloans. So we do not have much of that now. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nThank you. On retail, the question is, is the turnaround largely done? Because there were \nthree parts from what I understand. The B2C rationalization, which as we saw today, you \nguys are adding stores. Second was on the B2B side, and third one was fashion being slow. \nSo where are we in terms of B2B rationalization and fashion uptake. \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja \n \nSee, it is pretty much done. So if you look at on the store side, we continue to add new stores \nwhile we weeded out all the stores which did not make sense, right? So we opened 2700 \nnew stores, we closed almost 2200. My net addition is only 500. B2B also we have kind of \nweaned down some of the low margin categories which were not making sense. So, that is \nsomething that transition has also been completed that is already reflecting in the numbers. \n \n \n \n \n37 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSo, if you look at our margins, margins are expanding because of both of these. Now when \nyou look at the fashion, yes, the market has still been weak. If you look at most of our \ncompetition, the market is still weak. But for us Q3 was a good quarter even Q4. With all the \nwork that we have been doing on, reducing the design to shelf cycle, reducing inventory, \nincreasing the design quotient, making design more AI enabled. All of that is starting to bear \nfruit now. We have had positive LFL growths and double digit growth in the fashion business \nin this year. We believe it has turned the leaf and we will see this continuous growth quarter \nand quarter going forward. \n \nSachin Salgaonkar \n \nGot it. And when should we start seeing any meaningful contribution from Shein? \n \nSh Dinesh Taluja \n \nWe have just launched it. We just did a beta launch in February. It is important to get a certain \nnumber of options on the platform. This year is when we look at meaningful scale-up. We will \nalso start advertising. You need to have a certain basic minimum number of options to offer \na customer the choice before you start advertising too much. The good thing is just when we \ndid organic, just on their own we saw significant downloads. It was one of the top ten \ndownloaded apps during those initial few days when we did the beta launch. I think as we \nmarketed and as we add more options, we should see the pickup in this year. \n \nJal Irani \n \nIf you do mind can I have the privilege of the last few questions. I have a series of questions \nactually on the new energy business, if I may ask them one by one. You all are obviously \nstarting module production way ahead of your own in-house consumption i.e., for power \nrequirements. Now, modules, as you know, are perishable commodities. Are you all looking \nto sell this in the market initially, especially as the DCI market is extremely lucrative? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nI think what Srikanth mentioned with respect to the generation capacity coming later or \ngeneration coming later it is about the significant capacity coming later. But as our modules \nget manufactured and as we have got the land in Kutch which is already in development \nstage, we will start getting the modules installed in Kutch itself. Having said that, the beauty \nof an integrated business model is it provides the business flexibility. As the markets give \nopportunities, whether it is Indian or International, we will benefit from those opportunities. \n \nJal Irani \n \nSir, if I may pursue further on that and I understand that basically your EPC has to start six \nmonths prior to actually the module production. And I am not aware of actually any EPC \nworks started materially as yet. So your module production is started, but it is still going to \n \n \n \n \n38 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \ntake at least six months to get consumed on site. So you will still have a module surplus \nstraight away, right? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nLet me just say EPC is engineering, procurement and construction, right? So we already \nstarted at least two legs and the C leg is also working or progressing. \n \nJal Irani \n \nAnd HJT is clearly the next generation technology, the Chinese as well are going slow on it. \nHow are the sort of initial efficiencies? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nIt is pretty good. \n \nJal Irani \n \nThe Chairman’s actually targeted 26% to start with and going to 28%. Is that in line? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nThe cell efficiency you are talking about? \n \nJal Irani \n \nYes, the cell efficiency. \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAbsolutely in line and we are seeing those benefits. \n \nJal Irani \n \nOkay and on electrolyzers, what sort of tie-up do you have with Nel and what is the \ntechnology? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nI think we have already announced that. There is a press release on Nel when we did the tie-\nup. Nel is actually one of the oldest electrolyzer manufacturing companies out of Europe. \nThey are very good in alkaline technology and that is what we think is going to be beneficial \nfor utility scale. We have a tie-up to set up the manufacturing as well as do technological \ncollaboration with Nel. \n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nJal Irani \n \nIn terms of economics, I mean the Chinese I believe, have reached economics of $350 \nkilowatt hour, right? And Nel is I thought more like 1000? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nI would not be able to give you the number, but I think in partnership with us, we will get to \nthe economics which makes us cost competitive. \n \nJal Irani \n \nAnd finally on hydrogen, how far is that out 2028 perhaps? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAgain I won't be able to give you the timeline on hydrogen, but we are very well prepared to \nserve the market. \n \nJal Irani \n \nBecause you have also won several PLIs, right? And they have got an expiry date. So, how \nwould you manage that? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nWe will deliver to the PLIs. \n \nJal Irani \n \nWithin three years, I think production is going to start. \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nWe will deliver. It is not much that volume is not significant, right, if you look at it from overall \nperspective. \n \nJal Irani \n \nAnd on target to reach a $1 cost? The last question, on target to reach $1 cost by 2030? \n \nSh Karan Suri \n \nAgain I would not be able to give you an indication on the direction on that. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \n \n \n \n40 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \n \nI understand that the mergers only happened in mid-November, but can you give a sense on \nthe growth that you are seeing because television advertising is struggling. It is still below \npre-COVID levels. And also your margins are only 3%. How quickly with whatever growth \nambition you have, do you see that catching up with peers who are at multiple of that? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nActually, at the moment, we are in the midst of growing our viewership, growing our platform. \nI always believe, I am saying is, if you can grow those two parameters, revenues will always \nfollow right? So we are quite optimistic looking at the start where we had whether it is with \nthe app or if you look at where our channels are performing on today's date in most in most \nmarkets we are leaders. We have got eight to ten of the top 10 programmes, and I think if we \ncan manage viewership revenue will always follow. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nYes but there seems to be something very structural about television advertising, because \ndespite 100 million pay TV homes and it growing, it is still below pre-COVID level in 3-4 years. \nWhile digital advertising has doubled? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nI do not know which source you're looking at. But if you look at the EY reports, etc., television \nis all way above the pre-COVID. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nBut is it growing? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nIt is. If you look at any of the reports that have come up, and the predictions for the future, it \nis showing a positive prediction. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nTelevision will also grow? \n \nSh Kevin Vaz \n \nYes very much. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nAnd your margin catch up, do you think the 3% margin will go to double digits is it possible, \ndigital and sports so do you have a margin ambition or a target? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nWe have margin ambition. We have EBITDA ambition. And this is pretty big what we have in \nmind is absolutely. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nCan I just ask for Anshuman one question? \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nThis is possibly the last question. \n \nDeepti Chaturvedi \n \nYou spoke about 5G monetization. So could you just throw some more light on that? What \nare your thoughts on that? Basically, how can we look at ARPU improvement, in the absence \nof tariff hikes? Obviously, 5G monetization should be key, 40% of subscribers now on 5G. \n \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nYes 45% of the data consumption, data traffic on 5G. And opportunity to give more services, \nso a combination of things like network slicing, being able to offer some differentiated superior \nservices, enterprise offerings so we see many opportunities there. The network has stabilized \nquite well, so we are confident that we will be able to demonstrate or provide those services \nand then be able to charge a premium for some of those services. So those efforts are going \nto be taken over the next few months, few quarters. Again, the reason I spoke about the \nKumbh case study was also because in very difficult circumstances, we were able to offer \nfairly differentiated services. Now, we expect customers to be willing to pay for some of those \nservices, enterprises definitely and we are differentiated, so no other operator will be able to \noffer those kinds of differentiated services. So both additional revenues, incremental ARPUs, \nas well as just getting more customers, because customers will look for those kind of services. \nWe see those opportunities in the next few quarters for us. \n \nDevanshu Bansal \n \nSo question on the retail business. Of the 2,200 stores which was streamlined, if you can just \ngive some picture in terms of between consumer electronics, fashion and lifestyle and \ngrocery, where the biggest part of streamlining happened. And also on the fashion and \nlifestyle, you touched upon, reducing the timeline from design to shelf and reducing the \ninventory or increasing inventory returns. So given the Shein partnership, is it also coming \nfrom their global learning or maybe is it because of the Shein partnership was done internally? \n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n© Reliance Industries Limited 2020 \nSh Anshuman Thakur \n \nSo I will answer the second one first and wait for Dinesh to turn up for the first one. It is a \nwhole bunch of projects we have undertaken over the last three or four quarters, over the last \nyear. We have had a big technical project to cut down on the time from design to shelf. And \nthat has been done pretty much by ourselves, based on our own experiences across running \nthis business for the last almost 17 to 18 years, the learnings that we have got. Shein is a \ndifferent business. That partnership is focused on Shein itself. And at this point in time, yes, \nthe effort has been to create the domestic supply chain, which we have been able to now roll \nout quite well. We have over 12,000 options on Shein now and we have been able to create \nthe domestic supply chain to be able to give that, provide a similar service as Shein offers \nglobally. But these are two separate instances. The whole tech platforms are separate. \n \nSh Gaurav Jain \n \nSo I think the question was on the store optimization. So I think it has been across the formats. \nWe have seen store closures but it is also because of a variety of reasons. It could be just \nabout some stores maybe have shifted because of maybe the trade areas or the consumer \npreferences moving. Some stores not performing well because maybe the mall itself is not \nperforming up to the mark and so it is a function of variety of reasons for both fashion largely \nand also for grocery business so it is both from small town to largely mall based stores and \nin large cities. So we have seen maybe just optimization in large pockets. But we have also \nreplaced all of those stores with new stores, so you actually see for the year, there is a net \naddition of about 500 stores. \n \nSh V. Srikanth \n \nTruly the last question, and thank you so much. We are absolutely delighted that we got this \nopportunity to present and have this interaction and look forward to the next one three months \nfrom now. Thank you.", "status": "success"},

Revenues grew by ~14% driven by\nhealthy export momentum and resilient volumes across key categories. The HPPC segment remained the primary growth driver, supported by\ndeeper market penetration and strong traction across agrochemicals, personal care, institutional and consumer business. The TSC and AHN\nsegments recorded modest revenue growth, contributing positively to the overall performance. We remain optimistic about their medium-to-long-\nterm potential, supported by ongoing portfolio optimization efforts.\nExport markets continued to perform well during the year, validating our strategic investments in global partnerships and differentiated solutions.\nWe are also encouraged by the growing momentum in emerging verticals such as institutional cleaning and B2C businesses, which reflect our\nability to build scalable, value-added platforms aligned with evolving customer needs.\nWe continue to invest in capacity enhancement to strengthen our growth foundation and are pleased to announce an additional capex of Rs. 97\ncrore for expansions at our subsidiaries, Unitop Chemicals and Tristar Intermediates, along with Rs. 95 crore at Rossari Biotech. These projects,\nexpected to be commissioned in a phased manner by Q4 FY26, are aimed at supporting growth across our key chemistries, improving operational\nefficiency, and enhancing supply reliability. Our previously announced expansion projects are progressing well, with commissioning expected by\nQ2 FY26. With these capacity additions, we are well-positioned to meet growing demand across end-user industries.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth through sharp execution, customer-centric innovation, and\nstrategic diversification.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that \nan audit conducted \nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when \nit exists. \nMisstatements can \narise from fraud \nor error and are considered \nmaterial \nif, \nindividually \nor \nin \nthe \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of these standalone financial results. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional \nskepticism throughout the audit.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that \nan audit conducted \nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when \nit exists. \nMisstatements can \narise from fraud \nor error and are considered \nmaterial \nif, \nindividually \nor \nin \nthe \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of these standalone financial results. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional \nskepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n(i) \nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial results, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain \naudit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not \ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as \nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control. \n(ii) \nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the company's internal control. \n(iii) \nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management. \n(iv) \nEvaluate the appropriateness and reasonableness of disclosures made by the Board of Directors in \nterms of the requirements specified under Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. \n(v) \nConclude’on the appropriateriess of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting \nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the company to continue as a going \nconcern. \nIf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \nauditors’ report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial results or, \nif such disclosures \nare inadequate, to modify our opinion.
